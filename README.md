# How to use it
Note: All the ipython notebook files are for testing only, codes might not be correct. So please use the file scrape_one_page.py for future development.

**TO DO**

Write 3 new functions to achieve the following

1. parse last name and first name
2. write code to validate whether the search ID exist before scraping the website
3. write to excel

*When Scraping*

I recommend to set a sleeping period in case the website has anti-scraping feature.
