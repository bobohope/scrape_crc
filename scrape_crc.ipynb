Clearly, the optical industry is here to stay and grow, requiring ever-increasing numbers of highly qualified engineers and scientists in photonics.  At the same time, the Canadian optics industrial sector faces worldwide competition that is fiercer than ever, and the next generation of optical devices and processes must be even more efficient, less expensive, and more powerful.  Both glass and plastics are used in the optical industry. Components made of glass have penetrated the markets for optical devices. Highly transparent and very easily matched to optical fibres (also made of glass), they are also inherently very stable and immune to environmental degradation. Organic materials (plastics) are also finding niche applications for certain optical processes and will certainly gain importance in the future.  The research activity of Dr. Jacques Albert, Canada Research Chair in Advanced Photonic Components, is concentrated on the use of laser light to process glass and organic waveguide materials. (Most materials in which light waveguides are fabricated can be permanently modified when subjected to intense laser irradiation.) His goal is to fabricate novel devices for routing and coding optical signals. He and his team are creating complex structures, such as filters and couplers, in basic optical waveguides, which provide greater functionality and market value while preserving low fabrication costs. The devices are being submitted to rigorous environmental testing to ensure their reliability and conformity to international standards.  To fabricate these complex devices, Dr. Albert and a team of researchers have put together a versatile laser processing laboratory, which will become a training ground for experts in photonics and provide Canadian industry with new processes and devices for the next generations of optical systems.\r\n",
