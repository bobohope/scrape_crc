Developments in the last twenty years have clearly demonstrated that secondary metabolites fulfill many key biological roles in plants, and some studies have suggested that some secondary metabolites such as flavonoids (a group of aromatic compounds that includes many common pigments) may have important disease fighting properties.The Canada Research Chair in Plant Biochemistry and Biotechnology, Dr. Vincenzo De Luca, has focused his research on explaining natural product biosynthesis in plants. He will continue to study how plants generate cell-specific biochemical factories for natural product biosynthesis. The outcome of this research will be to produce detailed information about the balance of genes that are responsible for creating particular cell factories, and to create new pathways. The novel chemistries generated may be used to: defend plants against different plant pathogens; produce valuable medicines; produce new functional foods; and produce valuable new aromas, flavours and colorants.As an example of the research application in industry, simple field-based global metabolic measurements could be used to define the most appropriate time to harvest grapes for making wine. Such technology may also be applicable to a number of other crops. The value of this technology can be tested at Brock University's Cool Climate and Oenology Viticulture Institute (CCOVI), where there are excellent facilities for making wine under highly defined experimental conditions.Dr. De Luca's innovative, interdisciplinary program will involve the collaborative efforts of molecular biologists, plant physiologists, pathologists and analytical chemists. His research will attract students and researchers from Canada and abroad, since implementation will require training in the skilled use of novel tools for genomics, proteomics, metabolic flux analysis and metabolic profiling, highly useful skills in academic and industrial laboratories.

Stress has been conclusively linked to a host of mental and physical conditions. Depressive illness alone affects one in ten Canadians. Furthermore, depressed patients access health care services an average of six times more often for physical maladies both real and imagined. As cost for the treatment of depression and anxiety continues to soar along with the steady increase in new patients, researchers are redoubling their efforts to provide new relief.Dr. Hymie Anisman is a world-renowned neuroscientist and leading researcher on the causes of stress-induced illness. His exploration of the pharmacological and neurochemical basis for depression and anxiety has received numerous international citations. He and his team are now engaged in extending that research beyond looking for causes to looking for ways to counteract the changes brought on by stress.Dr. Anisman's research examines the effect that stress has on chemical and hormonal activity in the brain. These neurochemical alterations are the same as those associated with chronic depression. There is also evidence to suggest persons who might be genetically predisposed to depression (by family history) are made more susceptible to developing severe symptoms from stress.Stress-induced physical changes are also under study. It is thought that acute stressful events lead to alterations of immune system activity, making a person vulnerable to viral and bacterial infections which their bodies might otherwise resist with ease.Since bi-directional communication occurs between the brain and the immune system, the researchers are also attempting to determine what signaling molecules might be involved in this interaction, and how these come to influence anxiety and depression. As the central research continues, the researchers are evaluating various compounds that might reduce anxiety. These involve new pharmacological treatments, including natural herb compounds that have fewer side effects than current medications. "

Each species has its own unique way of dealing with stresses and lifestyle demands. For organisms in cold and northern regions, survival is dependent upon adapting to extremes of temperature, oxygen deprivation and water restriction. For some species, cells and organs thrive under such conditions.The exploration of cell adaptation begins with gene expression. What mitochondrial genes enable certain mammals to reduce their metabolic rate by 95 percent and core body temperature to near 0° C during hibernation? How can some species' organs sustain freezing and thawing without becoming damaged? How can animals survive for weeks at a time without oxygen? Delving into the genetic basis for such behaviour will ultimately allow us to apply what is learned to human cells.Carleton University's Strategic Research Plan in the Life Sciences takes a broad based approach to the study of organisms in their environment, with a special focus on northern and cold regions and encouragement for collaborations with outside institutions and organizations. The Biology, Chemistry and Biochemistry departments at Carleton University will presently be undergoing dramatic changes, renovations and upgrades in the interest of fostering research. At the centre of these faculties' work is that of Dr. Kenneth B. Storey.Dr. Storey has been part of Carleton University's Institute of Biochemistry since 1979. In keeping with the university's support for collaborative efforts, Dr. Storey has - while maintaining a multi-disciplinary career within the university, involving himself in the Departments of Biology and Chemistry - developed close ties with physiologists in the Department of Biology at the University of Ottawa.

With threats like malicious software and individuals exploiting Internet users for personal gain, it is critical that we find ways to mitigate threats. As Canada Research Chair in Authentication and Computer Security, Dr. Paul Van Oorschot is looking to create new defensive software technologies that will do this. He and his research team are focusing on user and device authentication. By better understanding the vulnerabilities in existing authentication technologies, they hope to reinforce existing methods and design new, more secure and easier-to-use techniques. Van Oorschot and his team are looking to strengthen security infrastructure for web server authentication by improving or replacing the certificate framework and protocols underlying the TLS/SSL architecture (the cryptographic protocols that provide communications security over computer networks.) In addition, they are performing concrete analysis and systematic study of realistic threats to current systems, many of which still rely on passwords for primary authentication. By helping us better understand software vulnerabilities, especially with respect to authentication, Van Oorschot’s research will improve the security of computer systems around the world. It will also lead to the design of mechanisms and architectures that are better able to resist practical threats, ultimately making the Internet safer for conveying and controlling valuable digital content.

Dealing with economic and political issues separately may work well for traditional economic analysis of how to achieve a particular social objective, or for narrow political examination of electoral contests, but not when a full understanding of the forces that shape our fiscal system is needed. A more complete analysis of the level and structure of public spending and taxing requires research that integrates public economics with the study of voting behavior, political competition, and electoral institutions, to create conceptual models of what governments actually do and why. Although research over the last few decades has advanced our understanding of the political economy of fiscal and other public policies, the gap between the fiscal facts familiar to most citizens and the structures found in most existing models remains too wide. Carleton University Professor Stanley L. Winer, a leading scholar in the study of public finance and democratic decision making, is working to bridge that gap. He is co-author of ""Democratic Choice and Taxation,"" one of the most influential publications on the political economy of taxation in recent years. His pioneering research is highly valued worldwide by his peers, public-finance economists and practitioners, and by scholars from several disciplines. As Chair of Public Policy, Professor Winer is working to expand his innovative, interdisciplinary work. His research is now focused on the identification and analysis of the permanent (or longer run) and cyclical components of complete fiscal systems, over long periods and across countries with different electoral regimes. He is also investigating the interdependence of fiscal and other policy instruments such as regulation. The general objective is a deeper understanding of the economic and political forces that underlie the evolution of our public sector. "

Dealing with pain in children is much more complex than in adult patients, since children often lack coping mechanisms and the ability to communicate the type and degree of pain they experience.Dr. Patrick McGrath has built an international reputation for his groundbreaking work in the field of pain in young patients. He has developed behavioural pain measures for short sharp pain, for postoperative pain and for pain in children with severe cognitive impairment. His work on the treatment of migraine in adolescents is widely recognized. As Canada Research Chair in Pediatric Pain at Dalhousie University and the IWK Health Centre, Dr. McGrath will expand the work of the university's Pediatric Pain Research Lab in areas including: delivery of care by distance treatment; the use of brain waves for pain measurement, and the measurement and control of pain in cognitively impaired children and infants. The work will come under the umbrella of two main research themes: the efficient and effective delivery of services to treat pain and other problems; and the development of better measures of pain.Outreach is a major thrust of the Pediatric Pain Research Lab, with ongoing projects that include the Pediatric Pain Sourcebook, a Web-based resource on pain protocols, policies and pamphlets, the Pediatric Pain Letter, a quarterly newsletter for professionals, the Pediatric Pain Listserv that has over seven-hundred participants in forty-five countries and a biennial international conference, the International Forum on Pediatric Pain that leads to the production of a book.

An urgent need exists for more effective models of marine environments as well as novel methods for analyzing the accelerating flow of data from various observing platforms including satellites and autonomous floats carried around by ocean currents. Dr. Keith R. Thompson is renowned for leading edge research in oceanography, and is a leader in the development of computationally-efficient and effective techniques of assimilating data. His extensive collaborations with regional government agencies, and key national and international partners will serve him well as Canada Research Chair in Marine Prediction and Environmental Statistics.Along with his team, Dr. Thompson seeks to improve the predictive capabilities of physically- and statistically-based models of marine environments, and to assess the impact of environmental change. His research involves four key projects focused on combining advanced statistical methodologies with time-dependent dynamical models.In one project, the team will take part in the Global Ocean Data Assimilation Experiment (GODAE), an international program seeking to demonstrate the feasibility of conducting routine ocean forecasts on a global scale. Dr. Thompson's team will focus specifically on the North Atlantic, combining ocean models currently in use at Dalhousie with new data streams drawn from GODAE.

Energy consumption has been increasing steadily due to industrial requirements and an increase in living standards. Contemporary life depends more and more on the consumption of electrical energy, for both work and leisure. Available energy resources with low-adverse environmental impact are growing scarcer. The addition of new electric plant and transmission lines is becoming more difficult because of economic and environmental considerations. These constraints, together with the increasing demand, mean that new solutions must be found to improve the efficiency of the equipment connected to the power grid, particularly the power electronic converters now widely used as interfaces between the grid and most industrial equipment. Energy pollution and interference created by the extensive use of these power electronic converters could create obstacles to further development in the future. Dr. Kamal Al-Haddad has gained extensive experience in designing and developing advanced energy conversion systems, including high efficiency, soft switching converters and high frequency power supplies for telecommunications, induction heating for manufacturing facilities, and other various industrial applications. As Canada Research Chair in Electric Energy Conversion - Power Electronics, Dr. Al-Haddad will focus on three key sectors: energy efficiency and electric power quality in electrical distribution networks; power supply sources for telecommunications systems; and electric traction systems for passenger transport.In addition to conducting fundamental and applied research to develop new technologies, Dr. Al-Haddad will train personnel with the aim of transferring them and the technology to industry. Dr. Al-Haddad and his Group on Power Electronics and Industrial Control have worked closely with industry in the past.

So convincing was the power of antibiotics that, in 1969, US Surgeon-General William Stewart declared that society could ""close the book on infectious disease."" But, in the years since then, his optimism has been replaced by a deep concern regarding the rise of drug-resistant microbes. Increasingly, bacterial and fungal infections have become harder to treat with currently available antimicrobial agents.As Canada Research Chair in Structural Biology, Dr. Albert Berghuis will aim to develop new therapeutics for combatting infectious diseases. His approach is to study different mechanisms employed by micro-organisms to circumvent the effects of antimicrobial agents and explore new strategies for fighting various bacterial and fungal diseases. As the name of his Chair suggests, Dr. Berghuis will pursue his research using structural biology. Using x-ray crystallographic techniques, he will examine the three-dimensional structure of proteins responsible for conferring drug resistance. With this approach he hopes to gain insight into the phenomenon of drug resistance and, by determining the atomic structure of proteins that are critical to pathogenic bacteria and fungi, obtain knowledge that will lead to the development of drugs that can be used to combat these micro-organisms.While the development of novel antimicrobial agents is the main objective of the research program, an extremely important component of the program is the development of methods in computer-aided drug design that use data obtained through structural biology techniques.

For example, determination of poverty and inequality within society are vital to formulating economic policies that can affect the lives of millions. Unfortunately, estimates of these types of measures are quite unreliable when based on common statistical methods. Frequently, policies are put in place based on little more than good faith because reliable methods of evaluating the results of existing policies are not available.The focus of Dr. Russell Davidson's work over the past two decades has been on developing new approaches to making inferences based on statistical data. Among his achievements have been substantial improvements to results derived from application of the so-called bootstrap method of estimating the probability distribution of a statistic. Working in conjunction with James MacKinnon, Dr. Davidson developed a way of greatly simplifying and shortening the computations needed to implement the bootstrap method. This allows the bootstrap to be applied in situations where the difficulty of the required computations might otherwise make it infeasible.His program at McGill University will build on his achievements, extending the use of the bootstrap method to a wide variety of econometric applications, including inequality and poverty measurement. He will also focus on developing computational methods that make his new bootstrap techniques easy to use.Dr. Davidson expects that his new work will have its greatest impact on everyday econometric practice. His primary goal is to discover techniques and methods that improve econometrics by increasing efficiency and ease of application. He believes that only through additional work will the bootstrap method reach its potential as a tool to influence policy decisions. "

Emitting bursts of radiation as they rotate, these objects pulse regularly like exotic lighthouses.Neutron stars represent the final stages of the life of a star that has exploded. As a result, they can tell us a great deal about the properties of larger stars, how they collapse, and what happens to them as they do so.They also tell us a great deal about how matter behaves under conditions of radiation and gravity that are more extreme than anything we could duplicate in a laboratory. What we learn about this physical behaviour opens up new avenues for understanding the very nature of matter, and how we might deal with it under less extreme settings here on earth.For that reason, the questions surrounding the properties of neutron stars have major implications for a broad range of issues in astrophysics, as well as physics in general. Victoria Kaspi has examined many of those issues, using earth-based observatories as well as a new generation of orbiting satellites designed for astronomical research.Her work has focused specifically on the timing of electromagnetic pulses from neutron stars, which can indicate the degree of turbulence in the almost empty space between stars.

Not a standard dosage calculated by body weight-disregarding your age, sex, or pain threshold. But a regimen of pain-relieving therapy calculated just for you. Sound too good to be true? Not really. The era of designer painkillers may sound like science fiction, but it's fast approaching. In this new universe of individualized drug therapy, designer painkillers would be based on each patient's genetic markers. And on the specific environmental factors that triggered that patient's reaction to pain. The concept was born less than a decade ago, when Jeffrey Mogil and colleagues identified sex-specific genetic circuitry that governs the way males and females respond to pain. The groundbreaking discovery-since confirmed by other scientists-opened a whole new field. Now researchers are exploring the different ways that pain affects men and women. Scientists have long known that when asked to plunge an arm into ice-cold water, some people have no trouble leaving it there for three minutes. Others can't stand the discomfort for even one minute. A standard dosage of morphine relieves the pain of most patients. But for 20 percent of the population, even a high dose is ineffective. Up until now, this type of reaction was mostly a mystery. Mogil's research is beginning to provide the reasons for those different responses, which often vary by gender. Following his initial breakthrough, Mogil has been examining the genetic bases and environmental influences that combine to govern reactions to pain. At a minimum, pinpointing relevant genes can help doctors tailor dosages of drugs to each patient's needs. At best, Mogil's work may lead to new drugs providing life-saving pain relief, as anyone living with chronically debilitating conditions such as arthritis or ruptured discs can attest. The research chair at McGill University will not only help to consolidate Montreal's reputation as a leading centre for pain research, it will secure Mogil's return to Canada from the United States. Ultimately, it will increase Canada's competitive advantage in this promising new field of research. "

It has long been known that hormones and growth factors play an important part in the development of malignancy in humans, and estrogen receptors have long been useful predictive prognostic indicators.Dr. William Muller's work to date has focused on elucidating the molecular mechanism by which oncogenes - genes that turn normal cells into tumorous cells - are involved in inducing breast cancer in a murine system. He has also developed a large series of transgenic animals that have allowed him to address the effects of various signalling and growth factors in the development of malignancy. As Canada Research Chair in Molecular Oncology, Dr. Muller plans to continue to investigate the interrelationship between distinct hormone, growth factor and signalling pathways in the induction of breast cancer. He will do this by using a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches, with transgenic mouse models. He believes that his molecular studies into the basis of breast cancer will lead to the discovery of new proteins that play a key role in the induction of the disease.Dr. Muller's research will overlap four areas that McGill University's Faculty of Medicine focuses on: integrative genomics, molecular medicine, bioinformatics and structural biology.

His work will also be a part of the integrated research that is going to be conducted at the McGill Life Sciences Complex. His interests also extend to a specialized class of proteins known as chaperones, which oversee how proteins fold themselves into the correct shape to carry out their physiological duties. These proteins play a significant role in medical problems such as Alzheimer's disease or immune system disorders, a role that might serve as the target for an innovative drug therapy.The work of Dr. Thomas and his colleagues builds on pioneering research into a molecular chaperone called calnexin, which acts as a quality control mechanism for mutant proteins found within cells. When this mechanism fails to function, the improper folding of molecules can result in degenerative diseases. "

Vision scientists have developed many sophisticated theories about how we are able to detect, discriminate, and identify simple patterns such as spots and lines. But we are still a long way from understanding whether these theories can account for our remarkable ability to perceive complex patterns such as the face of a friend. As the Canada Research Chair in Vision Science, Patrick Bennett will join a team of researchers at McMaster University whose combined multidisciplinary expertise is unique within Canada and around the world. This multidisciplinary approach will enable Dr. Bennett to further our understanding of the hidden complexities underlying vision in everyday tasks. His work will apply advanced quantitative methods to determine how sensory and cognitive processes constrain our perception of the world, and will take advantage of modern medical imaging techniques to determine the precise nature of the neural systems underlying this perception. An additional focus of this work involves understanding how neural systems that underlie perception in adult brains change as a function of learning and aging. It is becoming increasingly clear that neural circuits are not fixed in the adult brain, and that new neurons can be generated throughout our lifetimes. These results raise the exciting possibility that behavioural therapies might be used to counteract the effects of injury or aging by stimulating the development of new functional networks in the brain.Dr. Bennett's own research has already shown that young and old brains encode visual information in very different ways, and that the strategies used by the brain for visual recognition can change dramatically as a function of learning. The goals of future work are to understand the conditions that enable perceptual learning to occur, to identify the ways in which visual mechanisms change with experience, and to determine whether practice on perceptual and cognitive tasks can produce long-lasting improvements in visual performance in older adults. The results of this work may lead to the development of innovative behavioural therapies to diminish the effects of aging on vision, and to enhance the quality of life for older Canadians. "

In his program as Canada Research Chair in Electron Microscopy of Nanostructured Materials, Dr. Botton will use TEM/EELS technology to achieve three goals: improve techniques to detect signals from few atomic layers at interfaces and nanostructures; develop models to describe the analytical data in terms of structure and bonding changes; and describe the relationships between the observations and the properties of the materials.His research will fall into three separate projects.First, he will examine the interfaces in nanostructured materials to provide high-resolution spectroscopic data to understand the structure and bonding relationships at interfaces and relate the data to the properties of these interfaces in engineering applications. This project will make it possible to understand the important elements that control the properties so that interfaces can be designed effectively, or new effects can be discovered and exploited.Second, his examination of the structure and bonding in nanoparticles for energy storage and catalysis will focus on the relationships between the microstructures observed at the nanometre level (shape, size and chemical state of nanoparticles) and the ultimate properties that are measured by macroscopic techniques. Nanoparticles that form airborne pollution will also be studied.Finally, he will focus on metallic and semiconductor thin films in devices to develop quantitative techniques to analyze the chemical composition at the nanometre level.

Much of his work is in the entrapment of biomolecules into sol-gel derived glasses, which leads to development of improved bioanalytical devices. His work intertwines materials science, biochemistry and analytical chemistry in a unique manner to produce new assays and analytical devices that have the potential to revolutionize the areas of biosensing and drug discovery. The goal of his research group is to become a world leader in the development of advanced sol-gel based biomaterials, biosensor technologies and high-throughput drug screening platforms.As Canada Research Chair in Bioanalytical Chemistry, Dr. Brennan will use a highly interdisciplinary approach to enable him to achieve his research goals of: developing new matrixes for the immobilization of functional biomolecules; the development of improved analytical devices based on sol-gel immobilized biomolecules, and; the extension of the range of biomolecules that can be used for sensing and screening purposes.

Deborah Cook's study of how to improve the medical profession's application of new knowledge could save lives. And it's all based on keeping a patient's chin up. Literally.The McMaster University professor is concentrating her research on a critical and often neglected area of study: how to translate new discoveries into effective clinical practice. Cook is focusing on studies that have discovered there is a practical, non-invasive way to reduce the risk of pneumonia in critically ill patients who are hooked up to ventilators in the Intensive Care Unit of hospitals.Statistics indicate that between 10% and 50% of all patients on mechanical ventilators develop pneumonia. The infection prolongs their time in hospital and increases their risk of dying. But studies have shown that if patients are elevated, by raising the head of the bed to a 45-degree angle, their risk of contracting this type of pneumonia drops drastically. All due to a simple re-positioning-from lying flat to sitting up. In fact, for every four patients repositioned this way, one case of pneumonia is prevented.Given the simplicity of the procedure, it should be applied in every ICU unit in Canada. But that's not always the case. Cook's study has demonstrated that caregivers in ICUs have not adopted the procedure. In addition, her research will use ventilator-associated pneumonia as a model to study ways to spread information quickly and to transfer research into best medical practice. It will also highlight an important lesson to the medical and research communities: that research that has practical applications must be applied so that the discoveries can have any meaning and effect on quality of life. The long-range, big picture? Cook's results can be applied to a variety of illnesses and to new ways to treat or prevent them.Cook was the first intensive-care specialist in Canada who is also educated in biostatistics and clinical epidemiology (the causes, distribution, and control of diseases in populations). The benefits have been numerous. Her combined specialties make her an ideal choice for this project with its cross-disciplinary connections. "

What we do have is calculus and its sophisticated mathematical approach to modelling the actions of the world around us.Non-linear partial differential equations (PDEs) are the mathematical language used to model the systems in the world around us that change over time. Modern examples include the transmission of data over fibre-optic cables, determining fluctuations in financial markets, the activities of drugs in biological systems, and the spread of infectious diseases. Formulating and studying the appropriate PDE always provides insight into the behaviour of the system, and hence has applications in its design and function.Walter Craig is coming to McMaster University after teaching at the California Institute of Technology, Stanford University, and Brown University. He specializes in PDEs and their applications to a broad range of questions in fields as diverse as hydrodynamics and astrophysics. During the course of this work, he has also cultivated strong interdisciplinary links, particularly in theoretical physics and physical chemistry. His research has regularly crossed mathematical frontiers, especially with respect to physical phenomena featuring waves. As the holder of a Canada Research Chair, he will continue to concentrate on some of most fundamental topics characterized by waves. This work promises to address some major outstanding problems for which tidy mathematical solutions are not possible. Craig, however, will attempt to frame more sophisticated and elegant solutions.

By any standard, it amounts to a major honour and accomplishment. But what makes it even more notable? The Nobel jury didn't even see some of Russell's most prodigious writing. However, thanks to Nicholas Griffin, the world will soon have access to a vast inventory of some of Russell's most intimate, fascinating, and revealing writing-thousands of personal letters that he wrote throughout his life (1872 to 1970). And they'll be available in a very modern way-via the World Wide Web.After Russell himself, Griffin is perhaps the person most familiar with this 20th century intellectual giant's copious writings. As the holder of the Canada Research Chair at McMaster University, Griffin has written five books on Russell, and has two more in the works. He is also the Director of the newly created Bertrand Russell Research Centre at McMaster.But while Russell is best known for such daunting works of mathematical logic as Principia Mathematica, Griffin says he was also one of the 20th century's great letter writers. McMaster University's Russell Archives-one of the world's major collections of the philosopher's work-has almost 50,000 of Russell's letters. How does Griffin account for the amazing volume? Russell devoted some part of each day to letter writing and, even in his nineties, was dictating 20 or more letters at a sitting. The letters range from the Victorian era to those of the Cold War. They were written to people in all walks of life-including dozens of world leaders-and on every topic under the sun. In his new role as Canada Research Chair holder, Griffin will work to see that this historical resource of original material is made globally accessible, and that it will remain as a valuable tool for future historians looking for insight into Russell's work and times. The planned on-line edition of Russell's collected letters will be organized to be of maximum use to scholars. The edition will include keyboarded text to make it searchable, as well as scanned images of the letters so that readers can view them as Russell wrote them. In addition to heading the on-line letters project, Griffin will also direct the editing of the ongoing edition of The Collected Papers of Bertrand Russell, currently at volume 16. "

In Canada, the annual cost associated with asthma and allied allergic respiratory diseases is estimated at more than one billion dollars. Costs are expected to increase given that the prevalence of asthma in Western countries has risen sharply during the last twenty years. While currently used inhaled steroids and short- and long-acting bronchodilators are highly effective to relieve symptoms, it is clear that they do not impact on the underlying mechanisms causing asthma. Dr. Manel Jordana's goal as Chair in Immune Biology of Respiratory Diseases and Allergy is to unravel the cellular and molecular basis of the host immune response to aeroallergens.Dr. Jordana's program builds upon his research into the processes of allergic sensitization and airway inflammation. His central challenge is to understand why some individuals develop harmful airway inflammatory responses to aeroallergens. Dr. Jordana's primary approach will seek to establish and further develop experimental models that mimic the heterogeneity of asthmatic inflammation so that the role of certain genes, and of interventions to neutralize the function of these genes, can be investigated. His hope is that dissecting the nature of the immunological interactions between the external environment, particularly aeroallergens, and the respiratory mucosa will have far-reaching implications for understanding and managing allergic airway diseases.

The current approach to this problem relies on accurate diagnosis and treatment with specific anticoagulant drugs. It would be more effective, however, to deal with thrombosis in a fundamental way, by understanding the underlying genetic and biochemical events that give rise to the problem in the first place.As holder of the Canada Research Chair in Thrombosis, Jeffrey Weitz will seek out this understanding. Following a comprehensive bench-to-bedside program, he will explore the most basic molecular dynamics responsible for this condition, expanding this research to develop clinical treatments that have value for patients who have already been diagnosed and are currently being treated.This approach has already improved the standard of care being given to thrombosis patients. Dr. Weitz and his colleagues demonstrated the efficacy of a new drug regimen that could be administered on an out-patient basis, improving the quality of life for these individuals by enabling them to recover at home. At the same time, the health care system saved the cost of the five- to seven-day hospital stay the former therapy entailed.Dr. Weitz has also characterized the structure and function of various clotting enzymes, and has used these insights to create new types of anticoagulant drugs that are now being tested. He intends to build on this success by examining the specific molecular changes that take place in blood vessel walls and give rise to thrombosis.

Timothy Whelan has designed a systematic study to address this century-old contradiction.The goal of this research is to identify the optimal use of radiation therapy in the treatment of women with breast cancer and other malignancies. This will involve developing reliable approaches where benefits are maximized and side effects are minimized. This study foresees better-managed radiation therapy leading to better quality of life for patients. Dr. Timothy Whelan's experience with clinical trials guided him in the design of the program. He and his colleagues, in collaboration with other research facilities, will search for ways to ""fine-tune"" cancer radiation therapy. They will attempt to answer such questions as: ""How frequently should radiation be used?"" or ""How much radiation is too much or, too little?"" Arriving at an optimal formula for treatment is the central goal of the research.Complementing the research into improved radiation therapy will be an assessment of health services. Supportive care for cancer patients has traditionally received less attention than drug and radiation therapy. This study will look at non-medical services, such as homecare, nutritional support, and social and psychological counselling.The study recognizes the need for patients to be better informed about their disease and their desire to have an active role in the decision-making process. Many patients regain a sense of control over the disease and their lives by taking an active part in the selection of treatment. Dr. Whelan considers it important to document the influence that patient control has in changing the prognosis of the disease. "

The list of infections associated with serious diseases like these is growing.In this environment, effective drugs are critical to do battle. But as the use of antibiotics becomes more widespread, so too does the growth of antibiotic resistance. It's the bugs against the drugs. And the bugs look like they're winning.Gerard Wright's research concentrates on understanding the mechanisms that promote antibiotic resistance and the reasons micro-organisms become resistant. He is particularly interested in the enzymes that alter or destroy antibiotics. By identifying resistance genes, expressing and purifying enzymes, and understanding their role in the process of antibiotic resistance, Wright hopes to gather data to help reverse this resistance and develop new drugs.To study existing antibiotics and why organisms balk at them, researchers need to synthesize them in a lab. But many of these antibiotics can't be chemically synthesized cost-effectively in large-enough quantities to allow chemists to modify them. Wright is working on understanding new ways to synthesize particularly critical groups of antibiotics, some of them the last effective treatments for emerging superbugs.The ultimate goal of this research is the development of new antibiotics. To do that, researchers have to understand the way they currently combat infection, and the body's molecular processes. Wright and his colleagues are using chemistry and biochemistry to examine the use of new agents in the war against infection. One such possibility is the use of amino acids as an antidote to fungal pathogens-another living micro-organism that causes both diseases in people, and major crop losses from infection.The chair Wright will hold at McMaster will contribute to the creation of the critical mass necessary to result in long-awaited breakthroughs in the fight to combat antibiotic resistance.

As holder of the Canada Research Chair at Mount Allison University's Coastal Wetlands Institute, Douglas Campbell will investigate the mechanisms that allow photosynthesis to succeed under such dynamically changing conditions. In studying the levels and functions of the proteins and other biochemical agents that contribute to photosynthesis, he seeks to identify those features that respond to outside conditions by controlling and regulating photosynthetic activity. Dr. Campbell has already made significant progress in identifying the sensing and signalling systems employed by organisms to maintain photosynthetic equilibrium. It is now more important than ever to learn how these systems function, given the numerous human influences that may disrupt that equilibrium. As examples of such human impacts, Dr. Campbell points to the rapid rise in levels of ultraviolet radiation (UV-B) and carbon dioxide that industrial pollution has caused, along with increased temperatures and cycling of soil nutrients. Key plants and bacteria may not be able to adapt to these changes, and their loss could bring further unpredictable changes to the environment.

These reactions control biological events and are part of the processes that regulate metabolism, gene expression and cell division, as well as growth, development, locomotion, learning and memory.Proteins in living cells ""talk"" to each other in order to achieve many cellular functions. One of the most common forms of communication in all organisms consists of adding or removing phosphate groups to proteins. Protein phosphorylation – the addition of a phosphate to a protein – is a critically important regulatory mechanism. Much like attaching a switch to a light bulb, addition of a phosphate group to a protein can turn the protein on or off and triggers its biological activity. While protein phosphorylation has been extensively studied in mammals, research lags in lower organisms such as bacteria. Dr. Zongchao Jia, Canada Research Chair in Structural Biology, has been examining the bacteria E. coli tyrosine kinase (Etk) which is involved in cell surface protection. Jia is using crystallography, a powerful technique that can provide direct visualization of the three-dimensional structure of a protein. Based on the ""picture"" he obtains, Jia is able to uncover important functional insights into Etk. Jia is also studying a unique bi-functional bacterial enzyme that enables bacterial growth in a low-nutrient environment. Jia’s research will improve knowledge of key enzymes that are uniquely found in bacteria and which may have potential for the development of selective antibiotics in the future. "

Dr. David Lillicrap believes that the common inherited bleeding disorders, which include the hemophilias and a less severe but more prevalent condition known as von Willebrand disease, represent excellent, distinct models from which to advance our knowledge of the pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment of genetic diseases. As a clinician/scientist of international stature, Dr. Lillicrap has spent the last fifteen years heading a leading team of researchers. Their far-reaching contributions range from analyzing the basic molecular genetic structure of clotting factor genes to investigating therapeutic interventions in patients with clinical bleeding disorders. As Chair in Molecular Hemostasis, Dr. Lillicrap is now focusing his research on three key projects, all relating to the genetics of common inherited blood disorders. His first project seeks to develop a large database of hemophilic mutations to further knowledge of the genetic mechanisms resulting in the hemophilias. Project two draws on the large amount of basic scientific knowledge that currently exists about hemophilia A to evaluate the safety and efficacy of different protocols for hemophilia gene therapy, and to investigate the host immune response to gene delivery. Lastly, Dr. Lillicrap is determining the effect of a number of genetic and micro-environmental influences on the severity of von Willebrand disease. Dr. Lillicrap's research is expected to aid in the development of innovative strategies to diagnose and treat these disorders using genetic approaches. In turn, this will greatly enhance the quality of life for patients, and will make the treatment of these disorders more widely available and affordable. "

However, it is now clear that this has not happened. On the contrary, the global era has coincided with the emergence or re-emergence of a significant number of nationalisms, including Quebec in Canada; Scotland and Wales in the United Kingdom; the Basque Country, Catalonia and Galicia in Spain; and Corsica in France. Dr. John F. McGarry, Canada Research Chair in Nationalism and Democracy, has established a global reputation as a scholar in the field of nationalism. His research program has two broad but related goals. First, he will study the phenomenon of minority nationalism and its relationship to globalization in a number of contexts, particularly in the European context where this process has developed the furthest. Second, Dr. McGarry will research methods in which these minority nationalisms can be managed in ways that are compatible with fairness and democratic governance. This involves two broad areas of inquiry: the role that exogenous actors, particularly the new international institutions associated with globalization, can play in reducing conflict; and the role that endogenous democratic institutional design can play in reducing conflict. A central aim of the Chair is to establish Queen's as a national centre for the graduate and post-doctoral study of minority nationalism and its management in the changing international environment. Different facets of Dr. McGarry's research will complement work being conducted in three interdisciplinary research centres at Queen's: the Centre for the Study of Democracy, the Centre for International Relations and the Institute of Intergovernmental Relations.

Dr. Ian Moore, Canada Research Chair in Infrastructure Engineering, is working to improve this situation. Moore’s research on the behaviour and design of buried pipelines is ensuring that Canada’s annual; multi-billion dollar investments in pipe systems are more effective and based on a better understanding of new pipe infrastructure performance, the remaining strength of deteriorated pipelines, and new methods of repair and replacement. Among Moore’s key contributions are studies examining how buried pipes interact with surrounding soil, and the consequences of soil erosion as water flows into leaking sewers and culverts. Moore and his research team are examining the risks associated with frost loads, earthquakes, landslides and other natural phenomena on these pipe systems, so engineers can design more resilient systems. Moore and his team are also investigating non-metal alternatives to oil and gas transmission pipes, eliminating the potential for corrosion and reducing the risk to the environment. Many of Moore’s design methods have been incorporated into North American and international pipe standards, and his procedures are used by consultants to manage the risk of infrastructure damage during construction. His work in explaining the “diseases” that affect aging pipelines also allows the engineers who manage them to address the causes rather than simply treating symptoms. "

But how much of a role does human activity play in environmental change? Are people responsible for global warming, or is it just part of a natural process? The science of paleolimnology may be the best way to answer these questions. Paleolimnology uses the physical, chemical and biological information stored in lake sediments to track environmental and ecological change. Sediment cores provide a record of change over years, centuries and beyond, offering unique insights into the history of climatic and ecological change. Dr. John Smol, Canada Research Chair in Environmental Change, leads an international program in the field of paleolimnology with four basic goals: to track long-term trends in climatic change and environmental pollution; to enhance research in the Arctic to track climatic and other environmental change; to develop new approaches to studying water-quality problems; and to develop new approaches to assessing pressing problems such as declining fish stocks. The work done by Smol and his research team is allowing scientists to offer advice on improving lake management strategies. Comparative national studies could tell us whether those guidelines can be applied to lakes across the country, or if they must be customized to each region or lake. This work is also enabling researchers to better understand and determine the role that human industrial activities play in climate change, and its effects on our ecosystems. "

His research program seeks to answer the key question of whether technology helps or hinders societal progress.The first of three streams of research he is pursuing is a philosophical one that is concerned with understanding technology as a social phenomenon. Growing out of a book examining the theories of Heidegger and Marcuse that Dr. Feenberg is writing, he will look at the origins of mass media and industrial design and their relation to the artistic avant gardes of the early 20th century.The second stream of study involves the development of case studies that illustrate the way technology impacts society and influences societal change. In particular, Dr. Feenberg will study the interactions between public will, economic forces and technical innovation.The third stream of his work will examine the state of on-line education and attempt to devise ways the software could be improved to deliver a better experience to users. As a co-founder of the School of Management and Strategic Studies at the Western Behavioural Sciences Institute in La Jolla, California, Dr. Feenberg helped to develop some of the earliest methods in on-line education. Since then, he has become an outspoken critic of the evolution of the technology, and has undertaken research to evaluate the software currently used and its affect on on-line education participants.

Many other bacterial diseases respond only to a single antibiotic, and are evolving at such a rate that they’ll soon be able to resist all available antibiotics. The way bacteria usually grow in humans (as communities called biofilms) enables them to adapt and become resistant to most antibiotics over time. As Canada Research Chair in Health and Genomics, Dr. Robert Hancock is developing new antimicrobial strategies based on an improved understanding of how antibiotics work and how microorganisms are increasingly able to resist even the most effective drugs. Hancock is examining the way small proteins called host-defence peptides—which are involved in the natural mechanisms of host defence against microbes—kill antibiotic-resistant bacteria. His research focuses on how they overcome biofilm-mediated resistance and stimulate innate protective immunity. Hancock’s research is already providing evidence that so-called innate defence regulator peptides could potentially be used as a new class of drugs to fight infections by enhancing immunity. Other peptides have the ability to destroy the antibiotic-resistant biofilms that cause two-thirds of hospital infections. Hancock and his research team are also developing and using advanced computer programs to study how the body responds to infection and inflammatory diseases.

Hayden's research examines how changes in genes result in illnesses such as Huntington's disease (HD), cholesterol metabolism and diabetes, and adverse drug reactions (pharmacogenomics). His findings are leading to new approaches to preventing and treating these and other neurodegenerative diseases. Hayden and his research team have developed antisense oligonucleotide drugs—gene “silencing” drugs that turn off production of the mutant huntingtin protein (the protein responsible for HD)—by targeting specific DNA variations. These drugs are being evaluated in a mouse that has human huntingtin genes with the targeted DNA variations. Hayden’s findings could lead to the development of a drug to be tested on people suffering from HD. Hayden's research into human lipoprotein lipase deficiency has already led to the development of gene therapy for hyperlipidemia and the approval of the first gene therapy product in the western world.

These surfaces make it possible to construct biosensors or diagnostic detectors for isolating sensitive biological products, which can then be processed without contamination or fouling.Charles Haynes has been among those who have developed such systems. He introduced a chromatographic approach to separating biomolecules on the basis of size, which has now become standard in the bioprocessing industry. More recently his work has focused on developing novel micro-arrays that employ peptide nucleic acids to interact with DNA, obtaining information about genes much more quickly and efficiently. As holder of the Canada Research Chair in Interfacial Biotechnology, Dr. Haynes will explore the molecular basis of such interactions. He will then apply this fundamental knowledge to the design of natural or synthetic surfaces that will make it possible to analyze complex biosystems at the molecular level, innovations that will prove to be crucial to the development of the entire field of biotechnology.

To achieve these results, the team is collaborating with visiting scientists from the U.S., France, Israel, Holland and Canada, postdoctoral fellows and graduate students.Pondering fundamental scientific questions is important to all modern societies. By gaining a deeper mathematical understanding of certain simplified models of interacting species, Dr. Perkins' research may eventually improve our knowledge of more complex models, and provide valuable predictability tools for application in other mathematical fields.

You probably see icons and the glow of a computer screen. But Tim Salcudean sees it differently. He sees a virtual world full of movement and touch.Salcudean is a world-leading expert in haptic interfaces. These interfaces allow computer users to feel and apply the forces of interaction while manipulating remote or virtual environments. The newly appointed Canada Research Chair in Intelligent Computer Interface Design at the University of British Columbia is researching the application of haptic computer interface systems to surgery and medical diagnosis and the remote operation of machinery in forestry and mining. In 1990, he made international headlines when, for the first time ever, he enabled scientists to feel atom-scale surface features. In 1997, he also received media attention for a vibration isolation device that he co-developed with Canadian astronaut Bjarni Truggvason. The device enabled scientific experiments to be carried out on the Space Shuttle and may also be used on the International Space Station.Salcudean's latest research is a continuation of this extensive track record of putting technical innovations to work. In collaboration with UBC colleagues, he will continue R&D; to create a multi-modal user interface-using sight, touch and sound-for robot-assisted medical ultrasound that could one day be used in hospitals and clinics all across Canada. Many ultrasound technicians currently suffer repetitive strain injuries in the course of their work. The robotic system will not only alleviate this, but will also allow for more precise and repeatable examinations and for ultrasound image-guided interventions.In addition, Salcudean has shown himself to be a prodigious graduate student supervisor. Over the past ten years at UBC, he has supervised 30 Masters and Ph.D. students, as well as several post-doctoral researchers. The Canada Research Chair position will not only allow Salcudean to continue his exciting work to the benefit of the Canadian medical community and the technology sector, it will also act as a further magnet to attract students from around the world to UBC.

Aboriginal people who use drugs face a disproportionate number of health threats, including HIV, hepatitis C, and death from overdose. Similarly, HIV has had a devastating impact on people in sub-Saharan Africa. Dr. Martin Schechter, Canada Research Chair in HIV/AIDS and Urban Population Health, has designed a research program that concentrates on young Aboriginal people in Canada who use drugs, and on people in northern Uganda whose lives have been shattered by a 20-year war. His research will monitor the incidence and risk factors for HIV and other harms, with the aim of developing effective prevention programs. His studies will focus on the effects of trauma as well as on identifying the factors that promote resilience. Schechter and his research team will also pursue clinical research on innovative treatments for heroin addiction, including medically prescribed heroin. They will develop new methods for providing effective health care to people with severe addiction, and for protecting them from the harms they face. A Canadian leader in the field of HIV and addiction research, Schechter hopes the results of his research will benefit Canadians with the greatest need as well as those devastated by war in sub-Saharan Africa, helping to ensure that we truly promote health for all.

Schluter believes the sticklebacks will provide genetic and ecological evidence of how natural selection drives the process.New environments created by geological upheaval can accelerate the formation of new species. Schluter is studying the evolution of the stickleback as a result of one of these periods of upheaval. Since the final retreat of the glaciers in British Columbia, thousands of variants of the original stickleback species, still found in coastal marine waters, have formed in freshwater. The freshwater fish include brand-new species, as well as populations at the intermediate stages of evolution.By comparing the different variations of sticklebacks, Schluter can assess how the populations evolve and diverge in traits and behaviour as they are faced with different resources, competitors, and predators. He is also able to cross-breed the new species in the lab, although they refuse to mate in the wild. The offspring of these fish will allow the scientists to examine and to shuffle genes. This will ultimately allow them to trace the genes that are responsible for the evolution of new traits and the origin of species.Mapping the genes of the stickleback and studying their evolutionary progress will help scientists figure out, and hopefully forestall, the reasons species are vulnerable to extinction. Schluter's research is documenting a model system of species for study, which can provide compelling examples of how natural selection works-fulfilling Darwin's design. "

Along the way, it affects sleep, mood, and cognition. In Canada, some 100,000 people suffer from Parkinson’s. The estimated annual cost to the health care system is $2 billion. To better understand what causes Parkinson’s and how best to treat it, Dr. A. Jon Stoessl, Canada Research Chair in Parkinson’s Disease, is examining the evolution of dopamine changes in the brains of Parkinson’s sufferers. Dopamine is a key chemical messenger in the brain that is released by nerve cells. The brain responds to most types of reward by increasing levels of dopamine. Dopamine, in turn, sends signals to other nerve cells. Damage to the neurons that produce dopamine is responsible for most of the physical symptoms of Parkinson's. Yet scientists increasingly recognize that the disease also affects other brain regions—possibly many years before a person even begins to lose dopamine nerve cells. Using positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, Stoessl and his research team are studying people who don’t yet have Parkinson’s, but who are considered at high risk of developing it. They are examining why exercise appears to benefit Parkinson's patients, improving their mood as well as physical function. They hope to identify patterns of abnormal dopamine function, and understand how non-dopamine systems may also be affected. This research could provide a first-ever record of the progression of Parkinson's in otherwise healthy brains. "

One of the longest standing problems in gravitational theory and cosmology has been to achieve a theoretical understanding of physics in extreme gravitational environments, such as black holes. In recent years, much of the interest in the field of particle physics has centred on string theory, which studies speculative models that seek to explain the nature and interactions of all of the elementary constituents of matter. String theory is now considered to be the frontier of gravitational research.String theory continues to evolve rapidly, and the past five years have seen some major discoveries, which in turn have raised new questions about how particles act and why.As Canada Research Chair in String Theory, Dr. Mark Van Raamsdonk plans to pursue three of the areas in which questions have been raised by recent developments: D-branes, Matrix Theory, and non-commutative field theories.Dr. Van Raamsdonk believes that it is essential to improve the general comprehension of string theory for it to be used to understand how it affected the cosmology of the early universe and how it may describe the world we observe today. The overall goal of his research is to work towards an understanding of the laws of nature at their most fundamental level. He firmly believes that string theory is the best candidate of all existing scientific findings to provide a consistent description of quantum gravity and a unified understanding of all fundamental particles and forces in nature.

His work has crossed many disciplinary lines, including biology, computer science and engineering, and has drawn extensive interest from a variety of organizations around the world.His program at the University of British Columbia as Canada Research Chair in Speech and Cognitive Science will build on his work during the previous decade at Japan's ATR Labs, particularly the development of a realistic ""talking head"" model that captures many of the fine motor and muscle movements associated with human speech production. The model incorporates three-dimensional features of the vocal tract, face and head to generate acoustic and visual signals in which the movements of larynx, tongue, jaw and lips are linked structurally and functionally to the motions of the head and face.Dr. Vatikiotis-Bateson's program will provide research benefits that overlap with several fields of endeavour.For example, using the talking head speech synthesizer, his team will enable research into the development and pathology of speech in children. The talking head synthesis system will provide a useful tool for studying anatomical abnormalities and limitations on neurological control. Another application will be the extraction of facial movements related to languages that are viewed as endangered. The results could be used to develop computer-based educational tools for teaching these languages in the future.

Which is truly extraordinary considering that the boys and girls she studies are too young to walk or talk. As the new Canada Research Chair in Psychology at the University of British Columbia, Werker will build on two decades of cutting-edge research during which she has precisely documented the first mental steps in normal language learning. Her goal is to use this knowledge for the early detection of children at risk for language difficulties. And considering her experience-in documenting the earliest stages of language learning, this world-leading psychologist has achieved several research firsts-the project is in good hands. In the early 1980s, Werker demonstrated that infants in their first months of life can already distinguish between similar-sounding consonants and vowels. She also demonstrated that this ability is universal: babies can distinguish these differences in any language. In the 1990s, Werker extended this research to toddlers and the initial stages of word learning. Her research overturned earlier theories of word learning by demonstrating that one-year-olds avoid the fine phonetic detail of new words in order to better focus on the overall sound of the words. In collaboration with an international team of colleagues, Werker is also turning her attention to language development in bilingual and multilingual children. Her preliminary research in this field has produced intriguing results, for it suggests that listening experience early in life, even in utero, influences the way infants perceive language. What else does Werker plan to do with her research findings? She's using this basic knowledge of early language learning to develop methods for early identification of language disorders. She's also testing word learning and speech perception in premature infants and those genetically at risk for delayed language development. "

Dr. Annalee Yassi, Canada Research Chair in Global Health and Capacity Building, is exploring issues that affect health workers’ ability to do their jobs. These issues can range from how best to prevent disabilities caused by work stress to preventing infectious disease transmission—with a focus on hepatitis and influenza in the Canadian context, and HIV and tuberculosis in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The knowledge and experience arising from her work is also being applied in ongoing international efforts to prevent and respond to outbreaks of this nature.

The costs associated with treating allergies - for drugs, time spent by healthcare workers and lost productivity as people miss work - is tremendous. So is the misery of the people inflicted with the illnesses.Kent HayGlass and his colleagues at the University of Manitoba's Immune Regulation of Allergy Research Group are dedicated to discovering why some people develop allergies and others do not, even though we are all exposed to similar amounts of common allergens (grass pollen, ragweed, cats and dust mites). They also want to develop consistently effective ways of redirecting the way the body's immune system responds protectively to allergies. HayGlass is a leading researcher in the field of immune regulation. He studies the roles played by cytokines, immunological hormones that control the development, activation and inhibition of immunity. HayGlass' work with cytokines also relates to research that he and Frank Plummer, recipient of a new Canada Research Chair, are conducting which explores the reasons why some sex workers in Kenya are resistant to HIV. Deciphering that secret would open up an exciting new avenue into vaccines or drug treatments to fight AIDS.

Uniting all these studies is the goal of understanding the basic biology of immune regulation so that scientists can develop new drugs or strategies to prevent or treat these diseases.Awarding HayGlass this research chair will enable him to pursue further studies into the way cells and molecular controls direct the immune system to protect the body - or fail to fight off invading disease. The chair will further strengthen the capacity of the Allergy Research Group at the university and give Canada another world class centre in this important area of public health. "

This is the revolutionary idea Dr. Lorrie Kirshenbaum, Canada Research Chair in Molecular Cardiology, is exploring in his research into regulating the growth and death of cardiac muscle cells.Kirshenbaum is fascinated by the behaviour of cells of the heart, which lose their ability to divide shortly after we are born and either increase in size or die. This is a critical problem for patients who have heart disease, because heart cells that die cannot be replaced. Kirshenbaum is studying ways to manipulate cell survival at the genetic level. His research has already demonstrated that particular genes are intimately involved in both the life and death of these cardiac cells. Aided by cutting edge gene therapy, Kirshenbaum is using viruses to deliver genes into cardiac muscle cells to direct them how to live longer and resist injury following heart attack.By introducing new DNA (genes) into these cells, scientists could potentially direct cells to suppress or kill cancer cells, or to kill off other genes which are provoking the death of cells that heart patients need.Kirshenbaum's research could have ground-breaking implications for heart disease, which is responsible for almost half of all deaths in Canada. Limiting the number of dying heart cells following a heart attack would greatly reduce the effects of heart disease. "

The human hand is an excellent example. A remarkable piece of engineering, the human hand can reach out and grasp objects with exquisite precision—far more precision than any robotic hand. One of the factors that makes this possible is our keen sense of sight. Dr. Mel Goodale, Canada Research Chair in Visual Neuroscience, is studying the different kinds of information used by the human visual system to guide the hand as it reaches out and grasps an object—as well as how previous experience with an object interacts with current visual information. For this research, Goodale and his research team use sensitive infra-red cameras to track tiny infra-red lights that have been attached to the fingertips, hand, and wrist. They use the data from these cameras to reconstruct the trajectory of the hand and fingers as the grasping movement unfolds. Goodale also uses brain imaging (functional magnetic resonance imaging, or fMRI) to explore how the brain calculates the sizes and locations of the objects being grasped. This work is not only providing basic information about how vision is used to control the human hand, but is also contributing to the design of better systems for controlling robot hands. "

The above are only a few of the many issues to which she addresses her research.Many of the Romantics are among the world's most famous writers. They include authors like Wordsworth, Keats, and Shelley, whose rich expression of emotion, heightened sense of nature, flights of imaginative fancy, and rebellions against social convention set new standards of excellence, and a style and depth of feeling that changed the course of literature.Rajan's work examines the ideas and common ground between the great European philosophers and these Romantics-as well as the discordant notes. Her acutely perceptive edge brings critical theory to a new level and extends this understanding of Romantic critical philosophy to North American literary studies. Her research provides a new way of writing intellectual history, and of marrying it to important literary, theoretical and psychoanalytical movements. Rajan's interdisciplinary approach will also extend to ways of studying cultural history, viewing it through the paradigm of post-Kantian idealism.Rajan will also be studying interdisciplinary ""systems"" of knowledge from Hegel to such contemporary thinkers as Foucault and Luhmann; she will also be preparing a book on Romantic narrative. Awarding the University of Western Ontario professor this research chair will heighten the institution's reputation as a centre that cultivates and sustains critical thinking, a comprehensive interdisciplinary vision, humane values and practical skills. Rajan's work has implications for some+ seventy scholars at her own university alone! Moreover, her work as a literary critic is a model of what liberal arts education seeks to achieve-the flowering of an intellect devoted to seeking profound understanding through analysis. Her example and her ability to teach will inspire the highest quality graduate and post-doctoral students to join her in these endeavours. "

For example, nanoparticles of metal and metal oxide can be better catalysts; nano-sized semiconductors will lead to smaller, less expensive and faster computers; materials with nanofibres can be lighter and stronger; and nanomagnetic materials will increase data storage capabilities. But utilizing their potential requires understanding the scientific properties of the materials, having a means of preparing them and tools to assemble them. A leading innovator in the use of advanced light sources, Dr. Tsun Sham uses a scanning probe microscope to rapidly collect the high-resolution structural information required to understand the size, shape and morphology of structures produced through nanomaterial synthesis. Dr. Sham is now focusing his efforts on the preparation and assembly of metallic and semiconductor nanostructures through electrochemical and wet chemical techniques using various templates. Dr. Sham is particularly interested in the electronic structure of materials in low dimensions, such as surface, interface, thin film and nanostructure, as well as light-emitting materials and using synchrotron as a probe. His materials emphasis centres on preparation and characterization, and the exploration of potential applications. Among the results Dr. Sham expects to flow from his research is a means of using the scanning probe microscope to routinely do chemistry at the nano level.

At the beginning of the 21st century, Gilles Brassard is applying quantum mechanics to computers. And the results could be just as revolutionary. What's the whole idea? Brassard says Quantum information-processing concepts have the potential to create a revolution in computer science. A revolution that could be as spectacular and far-reaching as that created decades ago by the invention of the transistor.Brassard is considered by many to be the father of quantum computing. In the late 1970s, he was one of the first researchers to apply the theoretical physics of quantum mechanics to the burgeoning field of computer science-at a time when the notion was thought of more as science fiction than science. Now, as a holder of a Canada Research Chair, Brassard will continue his groundbreaking work to apply the ""spooky action"" of quantum mechanics to information processing. Quantum mechanics explains the behaviour of the building blocks of all matter and energy, such as photons, electrons, and atoms. His research will further explore the potential to create quantum computers-capable of performing some calculations faster than a classical computer the size of the universe, at least in theory. This could have profound consequences for the security of transactions on the Internet, as needed for secure Electronic Commerce.Another area of enormous potential is quantum cryptography, a field in which Brassard has been a pioneer since 1979. Along with his extensive group of international graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, Brassard will seek to determine the conditions under which this quantum-based information privacy system could be practically used, yet unconditionally secure.In addition to this research, Brassard will continue his research into the fascinating world of quantum teleportation. This makes use of the most fascinating aspects of quantum mechanics to allow for the transmission of quantum information through a classical channel. ""Beam me up Scotty?"" Not quite yet! "

Babies born prematurely often suffer from mental retardation even blindness, and half of these infants go on to develop crippling Cerebral Palsy. Clearly, the cause and treatment of premature births is one of the greatest challenges in pediatric medicine.Dr. Sylvain Chemtob of the Université de Montréal is renowned for his leadership in understanding prematurity and its sequelae. He has identified a number of biochemical processes called autoregulation, which lead to normal circulatory function. But in the premature infant, something goes wrong with that process and otherwise healthy tissues are either subjected to excess oxygen leading to oxygen toxicity or are starved of the oxygen they need to fully develop. Chemtob's work has also led to new treatments for improving blood circulation to the undeveloped retina. As a result, in many cases blindness can be prevented.As survival rates for these newborns improve, so too does the technology involved in their treatment. New treatment modalities aimed at improving blood circulation will have spin-off benefits to the general population as well. Treatments and new detection equipment developed for the tiniest of patients are equally effective on adults. There are wide-reaching implications for many other research endeavors.Despite the progress already made, there are still many daunting questions. Why does the body induce labour before the fetus has come to full term? (Studies suggest hormonal and environmental factors are at work.) Can drug therapies alone reduce the incidence of premature birth? (The body's induction compounds often overwhelm existing drugs.) Can brain damage and blindness be prevented or reduced? (New therapies have demonstrated an ability to better regulate blood circulation in the tissues.)Numerous international studies have revealed a steady upward trend in the incidence of severely premature babies born each year. As his research continues, Dr. Chemtob will study the causes and outcomes of premature birth, and will develop therapeutic modalities to avoid potentially catastrophic outcomes. If the huge human and financial costs to society are to be reduced, prevention is the ultimate goal and continuing research the key. "

And what a team! Of the five doctoral students who have earned the prestigious Plaskett Medal, which is awarded annually by the Canadian Astronomical Society to the young researcher who has written the best thesis in astrophysics in Canada, three have been tutored by Professor Fontaine. Thanks to Professor Fontaine's ability to attract and motivate brilliant minds, the white dwarf research group that he founded has become a bona fide international institution.Among other things, his team demonstrated that white dwarf stars can teach us a great deal about the behaviour of matter under extreme conditions and about the evolution of stars. Making his own instruments, Professor Fontaine has developed remarkably effective theoretical tools and observation tools that are now used throughout the world.

Number theory also has increasingly important applications in theoretical physics and computer science. The research undertaken by Dr. Andrew Granville as Canada Research Chair in Number Theory is aimed at better understanding basic questions in number theory, particularly by analyzing the distribution of special types of numbers. His main focus is on the distribution of prime numbers and other important number-theoretic sets. To this end, Granville has worked with Stanford University’s Dr. K. Soundararajan to understand what happens when things go wrong. Their research has shown that, in many questions of interest, things only go wrong when a certain number theory function is pretentious—that is, when the function pretends to be something it is not. This understanding has allowed them to make several improvements for dealing with character sums and for proving the prime number theorem. Their work has also proven that mass cannot “escape to infinity” in the case of automorphic forms. During this chair, Granville hopes to show that most of the main results of analytic number theory can be re-proven “pretentiously,” not only giving a new, easier perspective on the heart of this central subject, but, on occasion, proving results that were unapproachable by more classical means.

These same innovations also create more demands for our attention, whether we are on the job or in our cars. At one level, psychologists use the term attention to describe the process of selecting one source of stimulation from among many. This type of attention is called ""input attention"" and can be guided by external signals, such as a sudden onset in the visual periphery, or by internal control. So-called ""central attention"" involves capacity limitations in post-perceptual categorization, decision making and other operations involving memory, such as encoding, maintenance and retrieval from short-term memory.Dr. Pierre Jolicœur's work has involved both types of attention, and his new research will seek to increase our understanding of attention using psychophysical and chronometric methods.His overall goal is to understand the role of attention in human perception and thinking, as well as failures of attention, which can occur when a person is overloaded with too many inputs or tasks to carry out simultaneously. Dr. Jolicœur's program follows three paths, including experimental cognitive psychology, computer simulations and modelling of cognitive processes, and brain imaging to determine how, when and why attention succeeds or fails.Beyond the direct fundamental science, Dr. Jolicœur will continue a number of existing collaborations with systems designers in the fields of computing and telecommunications to help develop new generations of devices, such as wireless personal digital assistants, that can deliver information in an effective and safe way. One aspect that is of particular interest is the determination of the limitations on human consciousness to undertake multiple attention-demanding tasks such as driving a car while talking on a cellular telephone.

Lepore is examining how vision, hearing, and touch interact in the human brain. He is also exploring the cognitive processes that are involved when we see and respond to emotional expressions. Lepore and his research team are studying these processes in people who have lost their vision or hearing. They are looking at what happens both behaviourally and cognitively, through the use of brain imaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), magnetoencephalography (MEG), and electroencephalography (EEG). By studying individuals with vision loss, Lepore hopes to understand how the absence of vision affects their other senses. So far, results indicate that the other senses supra-perform. Lepore believes this may be due to visual areas of the brain being colonized by the other senses. In other words, “more brain leads to better performance.” Similarly, in deaf persons, vision seems to colonize the brain’s auditory cortex, but with comparatively little supra-performance. Lepore is investigating why this is. He is also studying people who have visual cortical lesions in order to identify strategies for compensation and rehabilitation. Lepore’s research will uncover important information about how our brains interpret the sensory world. It may also lead to novel ideas about how we can improve rehabilitation strategies for persons with sight or hearing loss. "

Defects in these pathways have been implicated in several types of human diseases, including immunodeficiencies, leukemias, lymphomas and solid tumors. As Canada Research Chair in Immune System Signalling, Dr. Veillette will dissect the intracellular signalling machinery that regulates immune cell activation, using state-of-the-art biochemical and molecular biology approaches. His research will focus on pathways that are pivotal for normal immune homeostasis. He will use in vivo mouse models to complement his previous work with model cultured cell lines, an approach that will address the physiological relevance of the mechanisms being studied. Understanding the signalling mechanisms that generate and regulate immune responses will have a major impact on our ability to comprehend - and hopefully our capacity to treat - human diseases that include immunodeficiencies, autoimmune disorders and cancer.

Yet we have traditionally worked with materials found in nature, altering and adapting them to our use. It has been a haphazard, even accidental process. It's time for new approaches to the discovery of new materials.James Wuest has succeeded in developing such approaches. He coined the term ""molecular tectonics"" to describe his technique for employing molecules to build very sturdy structures. In this way, he has demonstrated the ability to construct materials according to our own design, rather than simply working with what we find.Wuest and his colleagues have been exploring the behaviour of a class of molecules they call ""sticky."" These molecules interact strongly and predictably with other molecules nearby, making them well-suited as building blocks for nanoscale construction. These frameworks have valuable properties of their own and can also be used to house other types of molecules, enabling us to create new materials with new properties.Wuest is eager to begin analyzing these ""supramolecular"" materials in detail, since their properties should prove to be unique and surprising. They should find applications in many areas, including separation and catalysis, which are important industrial processes.Wuest has been among the leading investigators studying design and construction of molecular materials. As the holder of a Canada Research Chair, he is looking forward to using a broad range of skills in making molecules and determining their structures and properties. By using these skills, he aims to ensure that Canadians possess a competitive advantage in the field of molecular materials which promises to help build the economy of tomorrow. "

The isolation of sources of vibration through the use of active and passive systems plays a crucial role in the construction of modern buildings, and research in this field has greatly increased recently. Patrick Paultre, professor at the Université de Sherbrooke, was one of the first researchers in the world to study the behaviour and modelling of high performance concrete structures under seismic loads. He also conducted the first research aimed at studying and measuring the dam-reservoir-foundations-ice interactions in Quebec's rigorous winter conditions. Furthermore, Dr. Paultre is one of the authors of the most exhaustive study ever completed on the damages caused by the 1988 Saguenay earthquake. He is a pioneer of the experimental assessment of the dynamic behaviour of dams and the founder and director of the Centre de recherche en génie parasismique et en dynamique des structures. This research group has been recognized as a centre of excellence by the Université de Sherbrooke and has received grants from the Fonds québécois de la recherche sur la nature et les technologies (NATEQ). The research that Dr. Paultre will conduct through this Chair has five main objectives: controlling vibrations in civil engineering structures through the development of so-called intelligent structures (i.e. able to adapt to their environment); modelling structures that are built using new materials; measuring, predicting and assessing structural damage; modelling and assessing the dynamic behaviour of dam structures; and renovating existing structures.

In certain materials, electrons collaborate to produce magnetism and superconductivity, states of matter whose properties have been harnessed in applications such as high-density storage using giant-magnetoresistance devices and magnetic resonance imaging using superconducting magnets.As electron interactions get stronger, the possibility for unexpected behaviour and even new states of matter grows substantially. This is what interests Dr. Louis Taillefer, who is studying electron systems where unusual forms of magnetism or superconductivity are encountered. To do this, he cools materials down to extremely low temperatures and probes the electrons by subjecting them to strong magnetic fields and by making them transport heat or attenuate sound.Over the past fifteen years, new materials have caused a number of revolutionary advances. A particularly dramatic surprise was the discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in a class of oxide materials known as cuprates. The mystery is how these materials can be transformed from an insulator to the best-known superconductor by removing some electrons. Cuprates seem to defy the theory of Fermi liquids - one of the cornerstones of condensed matter physics since the 1950s. More than 100,000 research papers have addressed the cuprate phenomenon, but no consensus has been achieved.As recipient of a Canada Research Chair, Dr.Taillefer will investigate various classes of novel electronic materials. One of his major projects will concentrate on the behaviour of electrons in cuprates, asking among other questions if Fermi-liquid theory does indeed break down and, if so, how. His hope is that his research on the transport of heat at temperatures near absolute zero will provide new and stringent tests on proposed theories for the evolution from metal to superconductor to insulator.

For example, copper wires feed electricity to our homes, nickel is combined with iron to form stainless steel from which everyday items such as cutlery are made, platinum acts as a catalyst in vehicle exhaust systems, and titanium in light-weight alloys is turned into bicycle frames. Estimates place the mining industry's annual contributions to our economy in the billions of dollars. How can we locate untapped resources to ensure future prosperity? The work of Dr. Sarah-Jane Barnes may soon provide the key.Dr. Barnes is a world-renowned geochemist who deals with precious metals and allied base metals. Her work focuses primarily on understanding the processes that occur in mafic and ultramafic magmas to form concentrations of certain metals in mineral deposits of economic grade. This research covers a broad range of disciplines, most notably field geology, petrology, silicate and platinum group mineralogy, geochemical studies, analytical chemistry, experimental studies and numerical modelling. With funding from the Canada Research Chair in Magmatic Metallogeny, Dr. Barnes will build on her highly developed expertise by furthering her examinations into the processes involved in the creation of ore deposits of nickel, copper, platinum, titanium and vanadium. Since such deposits formed from molten rock are considered anomalies, she must first concentrate on understanding how molten rock normally develops and then determine what is unusual in cases where ore deposits are formed. The answers she uncovers will ultimately enable better predictions of where to find Canada's untapped natural resources. Dr. Barnes will continue to conduct her work in collaboration with a team of graduate students. She will also draw on the expertise of several other researchers from the university's Department of Earth Sciences. Their discoveries, which will be shared with the international scientific community, should prove invaluable to the future of mineral exploration. "

Gérard Bouchard, a professor at the Université du Québec à Chicoutimi, is one of the world's leading specialists on the genesis and evolution of nations and cultures. A sociologist and a historian, he has won renown in these two fields to such an extent that a number of his colleagues say that he is at once the greatest sociologist and the greatest historian of his generation in Quebec. Few researchers have been at the origin of so many major projects: founder of the Institut interuniversitaire de recherches sur les populations (IREP), a research centre that, when he stepped down in 1998, had more than two hundred collaborators, some sixty of them accredited researchers; as well as being the creator of the BALSAC register, a scientific infrastructure that is unique in the world and that is known and used by researchers in various countries. Dr. Bouchard also created RIMA, an oral database that has its source in a dozen Quebec regions. Interviews have already made possible a detailed reconstruction of marriage rituals in a few regions, and the new Chair will enable the researcher to complete construction of the database, which will be used for studying the ethnographic aspects of imaginaires. The energy that Dr. Bouchard devotes to comparative research gives his work a dimension that extends far beyond the provincial borders of Quebec to include all of Canada, South America and even Australia and New Zealand. As Chair Dr. Bouchard will make it possible, among other things, to understand the collective Quebecois imaginaire, and to gain a more precise knowledge of the basic parameters guiding the genesis and evolution of national cultures.

Dr. Gagnon is one of Canada's foremost experts on comparative federalism and on Quebec-Canada studies. He is also one of the most prolific researchers in the fields of Quebec politics, comparative federalism and federal-provincial relations. He has published over 30 scholarly works, and contributed numerous chapters to books and articles to scientific journals. He has published works in both French and English and his works have been translated into Spanish, Catalan, Korean, Japanese and Portuguese. He is regularly invited by the media in Canada, the USA and Europe to provide analysis of current political events in Canada.

The written and spoken word allows our brain to categorize the world and learn by ""hearsay"", without having to experience every situation for ourselves. The question facing the world of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is: How can you teach any system, human or machine, language that allows it to understand its own world and ours?Dr. Stevan Harnad is one of the world's leading authorities on the evolution of language and speech. A Canadian, Harnad returns to Canada from the University of Southampton in England to expand on his existing research on how language is grounded in perception in humans, animals and machines. In educating either humans or computers, it is not enough to simply input words and definitions from a dictionary. This would simply amount to meaningless symbols (words) being defined by further meaningless symbols. To truly understand the meanings of words, the thinking machine of the future must first be able to categorize the world it senses and on which it acts.For human infants, language learning looks like child's-play. When a child reaches out to grab a ball, the parent calls out the object's name. Hearing the word, then touching the object, confirms to the child that this is a ball and that balls are round. Computers, unless they are robots, don't enjoy this direct interaction with the real world; their ""brain"" floats in a box of wires and circuits. To allow them the same learning opportunity, something else needs to be done.Cognitive scientists are accordingly creating artificial worlds for machine models to navigate, through actions and words. As these ""toy"" models grow in size and sophistication, they should eventually capture more and more of our abilities, first in sensorimotor categorization and interaction with the world of objects, then in symbolic language and abstract thought.

He was also one of the first to try to make a large-scale assessment of the impact of forest fires and logging on fish communities in lakes in Canada's boreal forest. In 1999, the magazine Québec Science chose one of his breakthroughs as one of the ten discoveries of the year. He demonstrated that there are two types of brook trout (speckled char) in the lakes of the Canadian Shield, one feeding on zooplankton and the other on insect larvae.

His program is focused on developing and implementing an innovative PCF-based enabling technology to achieve optimum performance from novel components and devices used in photonic sensing, communications and other applications. He will focus primarily on creating new applications that benefit aerospace, civil engineering and the environment. This applied and fundamental research includes three preliminary and three long-term objectives. Initially, he will research, model, manufacture and test new wave-guiding structures with unusual transmission properties that can be used in different sensing and communications applications.

Dr. Jean Bousquet, Canada Research Chair in Forest Genomics, is developing genomic tools for evaluating and monitoring our forests more quickly and efficiently. (A genome is a complete set of DNA within a single cell of an organism.) Ultimately, the goal is to develop better conservation measures to preserve genetic diversity in forests and speed up the development of trees that are more productive and well-adapted to future environmental conditions. Bousquet and his research team are focusing their work in three key areas. The first involves sequencing and mapping tree genomes, figuring out their genomic architecture, and building gene catalogues and large-scale registries of DNA polymorphisms for genotyping. Genotyping involves identifying the genetic make-up (genotypes) of trees and analyzing the heredity of their traits. The second focus is on finding out more about the natural genetic variation of forest species. Bousquet is using genomic scans to study the history behind the distribution of tree species today, disentangling it from natural selection or forest management to ensure better conservation measures. His third focus is on genome profiling to predict mature functional traits of trees at very young ages. The goal here is to speed up tree improvement programs and the deployment of productive plantations.

Development of the next generation of MDs-capable of motion that incorporates electronic, computer-guided control systems-will rely on state-of-the-art computer models and plain old-fashioned ingenuity.Canada is already an acknowledged world leader in the design and construction of MDs. While the past 20 years have seen dramatic advances in their design and function, those at the leading edge of MD research are preparing to take things much further.Professor Clement Gosselin has won international recognition by applying ""in-parallel"" design principles to construct robotic mechanisms that are far stronger and more precise in their movements. This technology may one day be applied to the construction of flight simulators to make them more energy efficient, and more realistic in their motions. The next phase of Gosselin's research is aimed at designing reactionless robotic mechanisms-devices that do not exert any reaction force on their base. Such a device would be particularly useful in space.Another concept that Gosselin wants to pursue is mechatronic integration. A design principle that demands the computer control systems of a device be developed in tandem with the design of the robotic mechanism. Current design strategies involve adding on the computer control package at a later stage with often disappointing results. The Canada Research Chair will foster the development of mechatronic integration by promoting the concept within the robotics community. Many industrial robotics companies have already expressed their interest in Gosselin's work. "

But have these countries lived up to their promises? Could law play a role in enforcement?As Canada Research Chair, legal expert Paule Halley is examining changes in environmental law and how these changes are helping meet the challenges of sustainable development and globalization. Environmental criminal law and its role in protecting the environment is one of her most important areas of research. ""Over the past 30 years, environmental criminal law has begun to outlaw different kinds of pollution,"" Dr. Halley points out. ""This has forced companies to introduce production methods that are more environmentally friendly and better meet their legal obligations to minimize risks to health and safety."" In fact, over the past few years new regulatory mechanisms to protect the environment have been springing up in Canada, the U.S., France and the U.K. over the past few years. By examining these voluntary approaches to environmental protection, Dr. Halley will examine how environmental agreements are negotiated between government and other stakeholders, such as industry and agricultural associations and citizens' groups. ""We want to understand how these regulatory mechanisms work and to what extent they foster public participation,"" she explains. ""This will enable us to assess their effectiveness promoting sustainable development and to determine whether providing them with a legal framework will ensure that they produce tangible benefits.""Dr. Halley will also be investigating the development of international environmental criminal law. She believes that the urgency to achieve sustainable development and the resulting concerns over public health, security and international competition will prompt countries all over the world to harmonize their environmental laws and introduce matching regulations on pollution. Using the results of Dr. Halley's research, governments, corporations and voluntary organizations around the world will be able to evaluate their strategies and adopt environmental protection regulations that are more effective and more suited to the world of today.

Such characteristics will make them a popular choice for building many innovative devices that might have been all but impossible to construct with traditional materials.Mario Leclerc has been exploring the potential of this new generation of polymers. His work has already helped to penetrate their chemical and physical subtleties, showing how they could be reproduced for industrial applications. And he has also investigated such applications, demonstrating the design of sensors that would be of interest in the manufacture of pharmaceuticals.As the holder of a Canada Research Chair, Leclerc will move from the development of sensors to the creation of polymer systems capable of manipulating DNA. This kind of technological platform will become the foundation for new work in proteomics, where researchers seek to learn more about the functions of genes within the body. As this technology is refined, Leclerc believes entirely new types of commercial opportunities could arise.His research is also considering the prospect of employing these new polymers as light sources.

If two inputs are added together, then fed into the system—and the output is the same as if you had fed each input into the system separately and then added the outputs—then what you have is a linear system. Linear systems abound in natural sciences, engineering, economics, computer science and communications. The key to analyzing them is spectral theory—the branch of mathematics devoted to the study of matrices and their infinite-dimensional counterparts, operators and spectra. Spectral theory has numerous applications in technology. Notable examples include feedback control systems, image compression and the Google PageRank algorithm. Dr. Thomas Ransford, author of two monographs and nearly 100 research papers in mathematical analysis, is passionate about solving fundamental problems in spectral theory. As Canada Research Chair in Spectral Theory and Complex Analysis, he uses ideas from complex function theory—a far-reaching extension of the differential and integral calculus—to establish new theorems about matrices and operators. These theorems have a variety of potential applications, especially in numerical linear algebra, the theory underpinning much of modern high-performance computing. An important component of Ransford’s research program is the training of highly qualified personnel in the modern techniques of mathematical analysis.

He is also responsible for a system for growing bovine embryos from cells recovered in the slaughterhouse-a system that is now used in more than four hundred leading-edge laboratories.The main goal of the research chair directed by Professor Sirard will be to describe and understand the genetic program at the start of embryonic life. The cells in the embryo that are at the origin of the formation of reproductive cells in animals and plants have much in common. Better knowledge of the genes studied by Professor Sirard's team should make it possible to produce healthier animals and food. Since all our food is made up of biological tissues, the development of which is encoded in DNA, the implications of such research are practically without limit.Aware of the new issues inherent in this research, Professor Sirard has taken the initiative of creating an consultative group to deal with the consequences of using assisted-reproduction methods. The group includes ethics specialists, legal scholars, anthropologists, geneticists, clinicians and biologists. Their aim is to set out guidelines for and restrict interventions in reproduction before the technologies become available, not after.

As Canada Research Chair in Aquatic Biodiversity and Environmental Change, Dr. Warwick Vincent will focus on high-latitude ecosystems to address issues related to aqueous and northern environments, climate change and biodiversity. His work will involve international collaboration across several disciplines and partnerships between academia and industry to develop and apply novel technologies for monitoring the freshwater environment. The program will examine the response of aquatic food webs to environmental change and explore the implications of these responses for conservation, monitoring and management of aquatic resources. This emphasis on microbial communities reflects the fact that their responses to environmental change are likely to spread throughout the entire ecosystem.Dr. Vincent will address three key questions: How will climate change affect high-latitude freshwater ecosystems?; How does climate influence microbial food web interactions at the river-sea interface?; and How will the microbial communities of human water resources respond to climate change?An essential component of research and training in each of these areas is to define the biodiversity of photosynthetic communities at the base of aquatic food webs.

Each new discovery gives rise to public concern related to ethical, legal and social issues. Despite years of careful public and academic consideration of these issues, governments at all levels continue to struggle with how to address them. To date, few meaningful regulatory responses have emerged - largely due to such challenges as rapid technological development, changing social values, and a lack of consensus regarding the nature and severity of public concern. But as growth in genetics and biotechnology expands, so too, does interest in health law; governments need reliable, informative data that will facilitate the development of sound policies and regulations. No one understands this more than University of Alberta professor Timothy A. Caulfield. As Chair in Health Law and Policy, Professor Caulfield is undertaking a number of large research projects to explore the on-going legal and ethical issues associated with genetics and biotechnology. The projects will address both general issues and issues related to specific areas, such as stem cells research. And since many are interdisciplinary in nature, Professor Caulfield plans to collaborate with experts in diverse fields, such as economics, philosophy, sociology, and anthropology. Although the goals of each initiative may differ, there are common themes. These include: identifying and clarifying the legal and ethical concerns associated with genomic technologies; exploring how these concerns affect the perceptions and values of citizens, consumers, policy makers, researchers, and industry; critiquing existing relevant regulatory and policy making frameworks; and making recommendations for future regulatory policy.

Unfortunately, many patients do not receive a transplant in time because the tissue cannot be preserved long enough to be matched with a recipient. Some tissues and many cells such as blood or sperm can be cooled to preserve them for weeks or even years without deterioration. Other tissues-such as corneas and cartilage-do not hold up well. As ice forms, moisture leaves through the cell surfaces, causing damage to the structure of these living tissues. In addition, evaporation from the surface of the tissue during the preparation for cold storage may further damage the tissue or, alternatively, aid in its preservation. At first, evaporation might seem like one of the simplest and most straightforward of processes. Yet, until recently, it was still too complex for engineers to predict from molecular processes. In fact, many industrial processes involve interfacial phenomena that appear equally simple. The result? The efficiency of everything from oil sands processing to the preparation of cosmetics is compromised by our limited ability to describe what is happening.Janet Elliott is among the leading specialists in a new thermodynamic theory formulated to address some of these difficulties. Her work has already demonstrated remarkable links between events in the exotic sub-atomic world of quantum mechanics and events in the much more familiar everyday world around us. Elliott and her colleagues have been hailed for verifying such links by comparing theory and established experimental results.Called Statistical Rate Theory, this approach provides far more detail about the behaviour of particles at an interface. Nevertheless, the theory is still trying to win support within the scientific and engineering community. Only a few stringent tests have been designed for proving its validity and expanding its applications.As the holder of a Canada Research Chair, Elliott intends to remedy these shortcomings. Working closely with other University of Alberta researchers in catalytic reaction engineering, oil sands processing and biomembranes, she foresees a much wider acceptance of Statistical Rate Theory in a number of areas. She also foresees the potential for application of a better theoretical description of challenging physical processes such as evaporation. It is a model that she hopes will address difficulties such as the preservation of transplant tissue. "

In addition, he will examine the factors associated with relapse and poor quality of life after discharge.The University of Alberta professor has already conducted primary research and systematic reviews of treatment, which have led to improved treatment for emergency department patients with asthma. He and his team have clarified the role of systemic and inhaled corticosteroids administered both in the ER and after discharge. Now he plans to investigate other approaches to treatment.This research chair will allow Rowe to test his hypothesis that providing medication in the emergency department will improve the patients' quality of life. Currently, many patients receive appropriate treatment but do not receive the drugs they need - either because their prescriptions are not filled or are not delivered through the appropriate mechanisms. He will also assess the value of ER personnel instructing patients in the proper use of their prescribed medication and on the critical importance of follow-up care.Rowe's team recognizes that one key to stabilizing patients with asthma is adequate communication between the ER physicians who treat the acute asthma ""attack"" and the family physicians who must develop long term treatment strategies. Rowe seeks to enhance these links as a way to improve treatment outcomes long after the patients' discharge from the emergency room. In addition, in collaboration with specialists in pulmonary medicine, Rowe will identify ways to detect and measure persistent inflammation of the airway. Emergency medicine is a relatively new specialty. However, Rowe's widely recognized work in acute asthma therapy has already had an important impact on treatment and has contributed to the establishment of national and international guidelines. Dr. Rowe is also well known for his ability to educate and mentor medical students and residents - an essential skill for building a strong community of ER researchers for the future. "

But ongoing research into the origin and occurrence of diamonds is needed to assure the future development of what is fast becoming one of our major natural resources. Dr.Thomas Stachel is among only a handful of scientists leading research in this critical field. Over the past seven years, he has conducted numerous groundbreaking studies on diamond inclusions. This award-winning work and his substantial number of papers in international peer-reviewed journals are leading contributions in diamond research and other Earth-related sciences worldwide.As Chair in Diamonds at the University of Alberta, he is drawing on his well-established expertise to study diamonds and their syngenetic inclusions. Syngenetic inclusions are minerals contained within diamonds that are formed at the same time, and by the same processes as the host diamonds. Studying these inclusions will provide valuable qualitative and quantitative data, which the diamond industry can employ to locate diamond deposits and predict their quality. Funding from the Chair is facilitating the creation of a state-of-the-art laboratory equipped with the most technologically advanced analytical tools available for diamond research. To further his success, Dr. Stachel is collaborating with leading scientists in the university's Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences, where studies related to the evolution of the Earth's mantle (the layer between the crust and the core) are already a top priority. He will also continue to work closely with leaders in the diamond mining industry, such as international giant DeBeers Consolidated Mines Ltd., to assure a continued supply of sample diamonds from various mines. The discoveries of Dr. Stachel's world class team should significantly advance diamond research and further Canada's leadership in diamond production. "

Canada's Arctic, despite its landmass, remains relatively unexplored from a biological perspective, and is a critical vantage point for observing the effects of climate change. The National Task Force Report on Northern Science recently identified a deficit in Canada's commitment to polar science. Awarding Paul Hebert this chair will help to remedy that deficit.The University of Guelph researcher will work with his colleagues at Guelph and with other universities and government organizations to encourage the construction of a laboratory in the Arctic for biological research. Hebert hopes to extend Canadians' understanding of biodiversity in the Arctic, and increase public awareness about the diversity of polar life.Among Hebert's areas of expertise is taxonomy - the classification of organisms in an orderly system. Gone are the days when that cataloguing was done by physical appearance alone. Today, the mapping of the human genome and DNA-based identification has revolutionized biologists' ability to classify species. Hebert and his colleagues will use a site in the Arctic - likely Resolute - to map all organisms in order to demonstrate that identification systems based on the analysis of a single gene can be used reliably to classify species in a particular system.Although we tend to think of the Arctic as a barren tundra, there is in fact a sea of life awaiting Hebert and his colleagues, from marine mollusks, fish and algae to plants, mosses, fungi, mites and insects, as well as mammals. The information Hebert gathers in his survey will provide insight into the way organisms evolved. He will also concentrate on making information about biodiversity more accessible, through his digital media group, CyberNatural Software. This group is dedicated to producing educational materials about the environment and biology. Hebert is already an international leader in the areas of freshwater ecology and evolution. Much of his previous work looked at why species are sexual or asexual and how this effects evolution. This chair will allow Hebert to compare the genetic diversity of Arctic animals with the diversity of animals in warmer climates to observe how species adapt and evolve over time. "

The University of Guelph researcher is delving into the basic structure and physical properties of fats and oils, be it milk fat, butter, cocoa butter or other substances. He is examining the formation of the fat crystal network within these products, which can affect such things as how easy it is to spread margarine, butter and other fat-containing products, or the consistency of chocolate. This research has key industrial applications for creating new food-processing methods and manufacturing value-added products. Awarding Marangoni this research chair will allow him to continue to study and characterize the structure of these soft foods, and to develop ways in which they can be modified to create specialty fats and oils with desired applications. These resources will also help consolidate Guelph's reputation as an international leader in food science research, particularly in the area of value-added products. Marangoni's research holds major interest for industry as it considers advances in food processing, food stability and shelf life, and food packaging.Marangoni is considered one of the top young leaders around the world in the field of food science. His accomplishments describing the nature of fat crystal networks and how they can be used to predict the flow of matter is groundbreaking science - an accomplishment which will be one of many as this chair allows Marangoni to forge ahead with his research.

Researchers are being asked to address the nature of this resistance so as to develop a new class of drugs that these pathogens cannot evade. As holder of the Canada Research Chair in Microbial Cell Biology, Chris Whitfield will be examining the behaviour of these organisms at the molecular level by looking at the structure and function of specific proteins and by examining the way in which bacteria regulate genes that are important for infection. Through an analysis that draws from several different disciplines, he will study the structure of enzymes involved in putting together the key components of the surfaces of bacteria and the dynamics of how the bacteria surface changes when it interacts with the body's defenses during infection. Because many of these surface components are essential for the survival of the bacteria or for their ability to cause disease, Dr. Whitfield believes that the enzymes will provide candidate targets for new classes of antimicrobial drugs. Dr. Whitfield has already worked with the Canadian Bacterial Diseases Network, one of the national Networks of Centres of Excellence, identifying some of the biochemical features of pathogens that would make the best targets for a new class of drugs. He and his colleagues at Guelph have already identified one key enzyme with commercial potential and they will now begin screening for candidate molecules that interfere with the action of the enzyme. Other targets are in the early stages of development. He has also identified some of the cellular machinery used to build large polysaccharides within the bacterial cell and transfer them to the cell surface. The resulting structure is called a capsule, and its role is to protect the bacterium from host defenses. The generic assembly systems are used by a range of different bacterial pathogens and Dr. Whitfield is beginning to answer some important questions about how the assembly of capsules is modulated during different phases of infection by particular types of bacteria. This program of inquiry complements several of the University of Guelph's strategic research themes, including biotechnology, environmental analysis, food studies, and health and well-being. The Canada Research Chair will enable Dr. Whitfield and his research team to expand the scope of their activities in Guelph and build on existing multidisciplinary and multinational collaborative efforts.

Dr. Bruce J. Balcom has proved this assertion wrong, having invented a series of MRI techniques that permit unrivalled and unprecedented visualization of a very large range of materials systems. MRI is probably the most flexible and powerful diagnostic imaging technique available to clinical medicine. However, traditional MRI is unable to image the large population of relatively immobile 1H containing tissues and structures - it only indirectly tells us about tissue. The family of new MRI methods (generically termed SPRITE) invented by the UNB MRI Centre permit the ready visualization of both mobile and immobile 1H in a large range of materials including concrete, polymers, composites, food materials and microporous solids. The successful application of these techniques, with allied hardware and software innovations, has opened entirely new vistas in materials science research. Dr. Balcom's Canada Research Chair in Materials Science MRI aims to accomplish three principal goals: to permit rapid and continued development of the material science imaging techniques pioneered at UNB; to permit the earliest and most advantageous application of these techniques by their collaborators, and to provide national leadership in the technology and applications of materials science MRI. His fundamental goal in technique and instrumentation development is to improve the sensitivity and generality of the techniques. Dr. Balcom's work has been recognized through extensive grant and contract support by a wide variety of international companies and research organizations. "

To achieve these goals, new technologies are required.Dr. Yonghao Ni has played a key role in developing the University of New Brunswick's Pulp and Paper Program, introducing important new techniques in processing pulp and bleaching mechanical pulps for paper production. His seven-year program as Canada Research Chair in Pulp and Paper Science and Engineering will extend his work in two areas.The process of oxygen delignification is recognized as one of the key technologies to enable pulp and paper mills to decrease their environmental impact and improve process economics. Dr. Ni will work to develop ways of increasing the amount of oxygen delignification that can be accomplished in mills without a resultant loss in pulp viscosity. The key is to remove transition metal ions, such as iron and manganese, which play a crucial role in reactions that lead to carbohydrate degradation and a reduction in the strength of the pulp produced.The second aspect of Dr. Ni's research relates to improving peroxide bleaching processes that will decrease the bleaching cost, increase production efficiency and improve product quality while decreasing production cost.

Despite the considerable resources spent on this research, relatively little attention is paid to ensuring that such discoveries are actually implemented in routine clinical practice. Consequently, the potential benefits of clinical research to the health care industry and to a population's health are often delayed or unrealized. For many years, researchers believed that the best way to disseminate their findings and see them turned into practical use was through publications read by their target audience. Although this has met with some success, the results are far from stellar. Implementation researchers (scientists studying methods to promote the transfer and uptake of health knowledge) now recognize that many factors in clinical practice environments may act as barriers to translating knowledge into practical application. In order to successfully plan implementation activities, researchers need tools that help to identify the potential barriers that may influence behaviour or hinder change in different clinical settings. This is the challenge Dr. Jeremy M. Grimshaw is undertaking as Canada Research Chair in Health Knowledge Transfer and Uptake. He is studying factors that influence the behaviour of health care professionals, and methods to help them use health knowledge more effectively. His primary objectives are: to build a comprehensive evidence base that aids national, provincial and local decisions about how best to use resources to improve knowledge transfer and uptake; and to develop practical tools that can be used to identify both barriers and facilitators to implementation, and to monitor performance. Several groups have conducted implementation research, but few specialize in this area. Dr. Grimshaw is integrating his work with other related research within the university, and expanding national and international collaborations with researchers and decision makers to create a dedicated multidisciplinary team comprising the commitment and skills necessary to lead worldwide implementation research.

",This research aims to transform Western criminal justice systems by placing human rights at the forefront of sentencing. ,Transforming the Criminal Justice System," Transforming the Criminal Justice System Beginning in the second half of the 18th century, a transformation began to occur in the justice systems of western societies as harsh punishments (in the form of long sentences or death sentences) started to be described as “humane” and “compatible with fundamental rights.” The severity of a sentence was no longer gauged by the intensity of physical punishment, but by the length of the sentence. From this point on, legally enforced punishments have mainly been measured in time. Dr. Alvaro Pires, Canada Research Chair in Legal Traditions and Penal Rationality, is a leading specialist in criminal justice systems in modern societies. His ideas have been borrowed, researched, and further developed by numerous authors around the world. Based on historical and contemporary research, Pires and his team have developed a theory about the influence of rationality on the criminal justice system in the West. The focus of their research is the relationship between human rights and sentencing in criminal cases. The aim of their research is to transform the criminal justice system to make sentencing more concerned with human rights. Pires also hopes to clarify the paradox between human rights issues and lengthy prison sentences, and to better understand why prison sentences are still widely imposed despite what he views as the long-recognized failure of this practice.

The development of models will allow statistical analysis and tests for a variety of questions pertaining to functional, historical and random proximities of genes. Comparing models with empirical data also promises to contribute to understanding phenomena as diverse as speciation, infertility due to chromosomal rearrangement, and chromosomal aberrations in neoplasms.As in some of his earlier work, Dr. Sankoff will also focus on the design and analysis of algorithms for genome comparison, particularly to solve the difficult problems raised by the incorporation of multigene families into existing methods. He plans to integrate the empirical knowledge gained in his statistical projects into the algorithms in the form of parameters for the type, size, location and frequency of gene rearrangement events.As part of his project, Dr. Sankoff will also establish a research centre for innovation in bioinformatics that will contribute to the development of a genomic research cluster at the University of Ottawa.

Statistics show that our life expectancy has reached an all-time high and infant mortality is lower than ever. But the statistics also indicate that health and health care in Canada, and in many other countries, is unevenly distributed along socioeconomic boundaries. Generally, good health and longevity are highest among the rich and lowest among the poor. Many socioeconomic inequalities in health are unfair and avoidable. They cause needless human suffering and lost productivity, and significantly impact the economy, social order and justice. Yet despite this, the magnitude of health inequities in most developed countries remains largely unchanged; in some cases, it is growing. Vital research is needed to decrease these inequities and improve the health of our most vulnerable citizens. This is Dr. Peter Tugwell's focus as Chair in Health Equity at the University of Ottawa. He has assembled a multidisciplinary team to establish an evidence-based approach to the study of socioeconomic inequalities and inequities in health in Canada and in developing countries. A conceptual framework has been developed for the Canadian component. Based on this, Dr. Tugwell and his team are modelling and developing medical, social, legal and educational interventions to assess their impact in reducing socioeconomic disparities among Canadians suffering from musculoskeletal diseases. The international component will use similar methodologic approaches to address major infectious, chronic and environmental causes of diseases in the disadvantaged with a focus on evaluating and enhancing information communication technologies such as decision support tools. Throughout his career, Dr. Tugwell has partnered with experts around the world working in other universities, at all levels of government, and in prominent organizations such as the World Bank and the World Health Organization. His team will now build on such collaborations to achieve optimum research results.The ultimate goals of Dr. Tugwell's ambitious research are to reduce socioeconomic inequalities, and to improve the health of poor and middle classes in Canada and internationally.

However, the federal push to reduce the sulphur content in diesel fuels has its problems as a green solution: the removal process is energy-intensive, and the resulting fuel works poorly in a diesel engine. Dr. Ajay Dalai, Canada Research Chair in Bioenergy and Environmentally Friendly Chemical Processing, is developing new alternatives, including an environmentally friendly diesel fuel substitute from organic compounds. Working with low-grade canola, sunflower, rapeseed and linseed, he uses vegetable oils, alcohols and catalysts to produce biodiesel, which will be tested for its properties as a lubricant. Using low-grade oils like those from weather-damaged canola and mustard seeds, the technology will provide additional income to oilseed farmers and create a local processing industry in Saskatchewan. Dalai is also working on ways to create liquid fuel from waste products, to improve gasoline and diesel using environmentally friendly solids as catalysts, and to remove nitrogen and sulphur pollutants from petroleum fuels through a process called “hydrotreating.” Dalai’s work offers solutions that may prove critical to Canada's ability to meet its climate change targets. An internationally known researcher, Dalai will be able to attract world-class talent to these endeavours, and continue to build on the strong ties he has already developed with Canada's petroleum and bioenergy industry.

At present, x-ray imaging is about 70 percent film based, and extremely inefficient and costly. Digital radiology offers enormous cost savings and other benefits, and with calls for both more efficient health care management and preventive measures such as routine mammographic scanning of women, there is an enormous need to upgrade the technology.Reduced cost will ensure that radiography is available outside of large, urban hospitals and clinics. Digital radiography will also introduce more flexibility into the system; instead of having to view original films, doctors will be able to process digital images with computers, adding to improved diagnosis.Dr. Safa Kasap is one of the world's leading researchers on photoconductors. His work on chalcogenide alloy photoconductor materials has contributed to the use of these materials in the new generation of direct conversion flat-panel x-ray image detectors that are poised to revolutionize medical imaging by enabling digital radiology to become affordable and convenient. His research as Canada Research Chair in Electronic and Optoelectronic Materials and Devices will focus on the properties of various new selenium alloy-based photoconductor films and look toward developing alloys that are even more efficient detectors. Much of the work will be forward looking because commercialization of flat-panel x-ray sensors for applications like mammography has outstripped the science required to ensure that the best technology is being used.

This allows him to examine how materials are bound together at the molecular level and to determine whether they are good candidates for semiconductors in extreme environments. Moewes is also pushing into the exciting new field of spintronics, which tries to control how electrons spin and to use that spin to store information. A mastery of spintronics will dramatically increase the processing speed and storage capacity of computers.

The recent invasion of Purple Loosestrife (a ubiquitous plant invader from Europe) is a striking example of natural selection in action. The reproductive strategy of this ""pest plant"" is so well developed that it has spread rapidly throughout much of Canada's wetland. The field of evolutionary genetics strives to understand the reproductive biology and genetics of such invasive plants, and those of more useful crop plants. Evolutionary genetics concerns itself with adaptive traits that contribute to the fitness of organisms, and is the key discipline for understanding the mechanisms responsible for evolutionary change. Dr. Spencer Barrett of the University of Toronto is a world leader in plant evolutionary biology, a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada and a former NSERC Steacie Fellow. He enjoys an international reputation for his work on invasive plant species and is an acknowledged expert on the potential environmental consequences posed by the introduction of genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Dr. Barrett's main research focuses on the evolution and genetics of plant reproductive systems. His overall goal is to understand how and why plant-mating patterns are modified during the course of evolution. An understanding of this process could lead to advances in genomic research and in the area of the evolutionary mechanisms responsible for plant diversity. Research aimed at isolating the genes responsible for plant mating will have important consequences for food crop improvement and the control of harmful plant weeds.The Canada Research Chair in Evolutionary Genetics links the traditional studies of evolution and biodiversity with the emerging fields of comparative and evolutionary genomics.

Her work in the area of methodologies of clinical trials and the validation of various instruments is recognized worldwide, and has resulted in patient-care guidelines that have influenced the practice of medicine far beyond the University of Toronto.As Canada Research Chair in Knowledge Transfer for Musculoskeletal Care, Dr. Bombardier will now focus her research on the development of information systems for evidence implementation (or knowledge transfer) for the most burdensome musculoskeletal conditions (lower back pain, osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis). The program of research will build on her experience on evidence generation and patient-based outcome measures, and will integrate them for use in clinical practice. This new focus will take advantage of emerging and innovative information technologies to deliver clear, succinct and user-friendly summaries of both research evidence and patient-reported data for use by the physician at the point of care.A growing body of literature suggests that computerized feedback to clinicians at the point of care is a promising approach.

Try understanding what it takes to be yeast. That's the approach being taken by a team of researchers at the University of Toronto led by Charles Boone, an international leader in yeast cell biology. Under Boone's direction, as a new Canada Research Chair at the university, the researchers are dissecting budding yeast genetics for a better understanding of the functioning of the human genetic blueprint. Yeast cells are useful human cell surrogates because their basic cellular functioning is identical to that of humans. Both Homo sapiens and yeast are composed of eukaryotic cells-each with a distinct nucleus that contains the cell's DNA. If you can understand the interaction between yeast genes and cellular functioning, you'll have a good idea of the relationship in human cells. The major advantages to studying yeast cells, as compared to human ones, are those of scale speed. While the human genome (the total of all genes) codes for tens, if not hundreds of thousands of proteins, the yeast genome these researchers are studying produces a fraction of this amount. The specific budding yeast in question, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, produces an estimated 6,000 proteins. Yeast also reproduce much more rapidly than human cells, and so genetic effects are quickly noted as a result. Boone's current project is to begin to understand the roles of these 6,000 proteins, and the genes that produce them. What do the proteins do? Which ones interact with each other? Which ones are essential to cell function? To determine this, researchers will identify so-called ""synthetic lethal double mutant combinations."" These are pairs of genes, which when both are mutant, result in a yeast's death. In many cases, researchers don't know the specific functions of the genes in question. Identifying the synthetic lethal double-mutant combinations will point the way to those genes, and the related proteins, that are essential to a cell's viability. So what does this all mean for humans? All the theories, investigation, and research may also point the way to new gene-based cures for diseases such as cancer. And knowing which genes are ""synthetic lethals"" provides potential targets for new cancer drugs. "

She has concentrated on two particular peptides, which are critical to the regulation of pancreatic cell physiology, and to the maintenance of the structure and function of the intestine. Those two peptides, known as GLP-1 and GLP-2, also play important roles in Diabetes Mellitus and Inflammatory Bowel Disease.Brubacker is investigating the properties of GLP-1 as a natural anti-diabetic agent. Clinical trials of GLP-1 have demonstrated that administration of GLP-1 to patients with either Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes can improve blood glucose control.Brubaker's research has also turned up evidence that the GLP-2 peptide has potential as a wound-healing agent for chronic gut disease, including Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis. Both of those conditions involve inflammation of the bowel, sometimes requiring surgical intervention and loss of a significant percentage of the small bowel. That loss, in turn, can lead to malnutrition or sepsis. Clinical trials have already tested the performance of GLP-2. Trials suggest that administering the peptide to patients with Short Bowel Syndrome helps them to absorb nutrients. Awarding this research chair to Brubaker will allow her to push forward with her groundbreaking research to explore the properties of GLP-1 and GLP-2 and their potential in developing new approaches to prevent and treat diabetes and Inflammatory Bowel Disease. Having too little GLP-1 induces a mild form of diabetes, while GLP-2 plays a major role in intestinal growth. Understanding the factors that regulate the secretion of these two peptides is critical to controlling and utilizing their function to prevent and treat a range of illnesses. These peptides will continue to be a major focus of researchers trying to develop new drugs. Brubaker is already at the forefront of that research. This research chair will only strengthen her position. "

He will purify stem cells and study how genes control normal stem cells in order to develop new stem cell-based therapies, including transplantation and gene therapy. In addition, he will study which types of normal blood cells can become leukemic stem cells and which genes may be involved. Dr. Dick's program has five major long-term objectives: The first is to determine the composition of the human stem cell compartment and the inter-relationship of the various classes of stem cells contained within it. Second, Dr. Dick will identify the cellular and molecular factors that regulate the normal stem cell developmental program. The third component is the characterization of leukemic stem cells and the identification of the cellular and molecular mechanisms that control their development. Fourth, he will use an experimental model to examine all stages of leukemic initiation, transformation and progression from the earliest disruption by oncogenes of normal HSC development to a fully transformed leukemic cell. Finally, Dr. Dick will use his knowledge of normal and leukemic stem cell biology to develop novel therapeutics. Increased understanding of HSC function will form the basis for identifying and characterizing stem cells from other human organs and tissues, including embryonic stem cells. This information will ultimately lead to a new generation of cell-based therapeutics for many human diseases. "

We have to start by explaining vector space, which is a set of numbers in which all the numbers can be added to, or multiplied by each other to produce other members of the set. Vector space is usually used in graphs, which normally have two dimensions: one along the bottom and one up the side. Hilbert space, however, has an infinite number of dimensions.The idea of Hilbert space is especially important in physics because a vector in Hilbert space is used to represent the state of a system in quantum mechanics. Now at the forefront of physics, quantum mechanics describes the physics of extremely small subatomic particles. Many of the rules of quantum physics are so different from the rules of ""classical"" physics that they seem counter-intuitive.As holder of a Research Chair in Mathematics, Dr. George Elliott will study how algebra works for operators in Hilbert space. An operator is a rule that transforms one vector into another, and the study of operators overlaps such other areas of mathematics as geometry, topology and number theory. The theory of operator algebras involves the way in which the order of operations affects the outcome.In particular, Dr. Elliott is following up on the surprising discovery that virtually all naturally arising ""norm-closed"" algebras of operators in Hilbert space can be described completely in terms of very simple data. This is called the K-theory invariant, although in some circles it is already being called the Elliott invariant. The importance of this simple description of what are called amenable C*-algebras - a very large class of objects with very complex structure - is that these objects arise in many areas of mathematics, and also in physics (in solid state physics, and string theory, for instance).Dr. Elliott's work could prove to be an important turning point in the history of mathematics.

And current public health guidelines may actually be contributing to the problem by recommending some foods that are high in starch and simple carbohydrates without respect to fiber or Glycemic Index.Dr. David Jenkins has attained international recognition for his work in quantifying the sugars in foods. He created the Glycemic Index, a tool that ranks foods on a high-to-low scale depending on the level of sugar they produce in the blood. His research has established that foods ranked low on the index may actually prevent some diseases.Diabetes, heart disease, and colon cancer all respond well to diets composed of foods ranked low on the Glycemic Index. Conversely, foods ranked high on the scale are blamed for the production of free radicals. (Unstable molecules that have been linked to premature aging and cancer.) Reducing the level of free radicals in the blood through dietary change is another area under examination. In diabetics, taking Vitamin E has been shown to reverse some of the damage caused by free radicals. Can healthy individuals also benefit? That's something Dr. Jenkins' research is also taking a closer look at.Other inflamatory diseases such as Rheumatoid Arthritis which results in long-term inflammation of tissues and joints may also benefit. It's believed that the presence of free radicals makes the condition worse. Dr. Jenkins theorizes that a diet composed of foods low on his Glycemic Index scale may reduce inflammation and may provide a new drug-free method of controlling chronic inflamatory diseases.The Canada Research Chair will allow Dr. Jenkins to fund the work of research associates, doctoral fellows, and graduate students under his direction. His collaborations with other institutions will assure his continued leadership role in nutritional research.

This significant contribution to the field has included techniques for scattering light through materials with different textures and densities. Now, the research is making way for a new type of medical imaging tool that uses light for the early detection of tumours.As the holder of a Canada Research Chair, John will investigate materials that further extend the concept of molding light. Called photonic band gap (PBG) materials, they are characterized by their ability to conduct light in much the same way that semiconducting materials-such as silicon-now conduct electricity.In fact, PBG materials could replace the current class of semiconductors in applications such as computer hardware. And their performance, limited only by the ultimate speed of light, would be much better. Above all, PBG components would continue to improve the capability of information technology. They would make it possible to exceed the restrictions that subatomic physics will soon impose on today's densely packed semiconducting components.But before this kind of progress becomes a reality, the physical qualities of PBG materials need to be studied and understood. Engineers will need to be able to design these materials to meet the exacting specifications of high technology. They will also need to understand how PBG materials conduct light, and under what conditions they do so.

In addition to the human toll of suffering and death, malaria results in a huge economic burden, depriving developing countries of an estimated $100 billion of growth during the last twenty years. Large increases in international travel and migration have made malaria a truly global problem. For example, in the last five years, Canada has reported a record number of cases and rates of infection that are between five and ten times those reported in the United States. Cases of drug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum malaria have increased dramatically, increasing the number of deaths and severe cases of the disease, and threatening the global blood supply.Dr. Kevin Kain has established a worldwide reputation as a leading researcher in the movement to develop effective therapeutic interventions and to characterize drug-resistant strains of the disease.

If we can stop these vessels from forming, we can stop the tumour from growing. One theory says that certain growth factors are responsible for the development of tumour blood vessels. Because these new blood vessels are biologically different from older, established vessels, and more stable genetically than cancer cells, they might be less prone to developing drug resistance. So rather than target the tumours themselves, Dr. Kerbel wants to attack the blood vessels that feed the tumours. Although this approach would not ""cure"" a cancer, it would slow it down and, perhaps, force it into a dormant state.One of the paradoxical aspects of Dr. Kerbel's approach is that, even if a tumour has learned to resist a particular drug, that same drug can be used to attack the tumour's blood vessel cells. This may have profound implications for chemotherapy, especially if it is done more often but at lower doses, causing fewer and less severe side effects. "

The defining feature of all her work is its ""bottom-up"" approach to the design and creation of nanostructured materials, where individual molecules are first synthesized, maintaining careful control of their size, shape and substituents. These individual molecules and their assemblies serve as building blocks for functional nanostructured materials.The first component of Dr. Kumacheva's research is the production of polymer-based nanostructured materials with periodic structure, function and composition. The applications for these materials include photonic crystals, which can be employed for optical limiting and switching in optical communications networks, and polymer nanostructured films with periodically modulated fluorescent properties that can be used as encoded security labels.The second component will be the development of hybrid nanostructured films with unique optical properties.The third element will be the design of polymer nanogels that have application in biosensing, drug delivery and chemical separation.Finally, Dr. Kumacheva will develop new strategies for assembling structural blocks of nanostructured materials, including the use of microscopic templates, the effect of surface patterning and a real-time study of the relationship between different factors governing particle assembly under confined conditions.

Premature infants are forty times more likely to die than are full-term infants. They are also at increased risk of cerebral palsy, blindness, deafness, respiratory illness and complications of neonatal intensive care. These complications cost the Canadian health care system approximately $2 billion annually. The emotional cost to affected families is incalculable.In the past forty years, there has been no reduction in the incidence of preterm birth. The causes are unknown but are likely to include environmental factors (nutrition and psychosocial) as well as genetic, physiologic and medical contributors. Precisely how these factors contribute to preterm birth remains to be determined.The overall objective of Dr. Stephen Lye's research at the University of Toronto is to understand the mechanisms underlying preterm birth and to develop new therapeutic approaches aimed at preventing this disorder. His team will use funding provided by the Canada Research Chair in Improvement in Health and Function for molecular analyses to define the genes that cause term or preterm labour. The team will also use gene expression analyses to predict which women admitted to hospital in threatened preterm labour will actually deliver preterm. In addition to high newborn death and disease rates, preterm birth also contributes to significant cognitive and behavourial problems in children and youth. Finding a way to reduce the number of such births would have a huge impact on the health, well-being and capabilities of thousands of Canadians.The interdisciplinary nature of the research program, together with the exceptional research environment at the university's Samuel Lunenfeld Research Institute will provide excellent opportunities for training graduate students and post-doctoral fellows.

Understanding how it occurs can point the way to effective treatments for this and other diseases.,Keeping Cells on Schedule," Keeping Cells on Schedule At any given moment, cells in your body are being created. But more importantly-others are dying.Although it may seem that this biological ebb and flow has the potential for extremely negative consequences, the balance is crucial to good health. In fact, the balance becomes most obvious when diseases like cancer strike. In those cases, cells multiply uncontrollably without dying. As a result, they are violating a process called apoptosis, an important regulatory mechanism that programs cells to die at certain times.The precise biochemical steps underlying apoptosis remain unknown. But researchers are sure that those steps include the key to the causes-and possibly the treatments-of ailments driven by unchecked cell growth.Tak Mak has begun to shed new light on the many dimensions of apoptosis and other mechanisms the body uses to maintain the order of its systems. His work has created an entirely new understanding of T cells, which lie at the heart of the body's immune system response. He and his colleagues were the first to identify the intricate chemical receptors on the surface of these cells, which enable them to distinguish a harmful agent and then neutralize it.In making such progress, Mak has honed methods of determining which genes are responsible for the function of T cells. Such genes take part in many different activities within the body, such as repairing the DNA that is necessary for cells to pass on their characteristics. However, Mak has concentrated on the role of these genes with respect to regulatory actions such as apoptosis, and the fact that diseases such as cancer can move in when that role is not fulfilled.As the holder of a Canada Research Chair, Mak will continue to unravel the details of these molecular pathways, which govern the growth, activation, and death of cells. Ultimately, he anticipates the resulting insights will point the way to new strategies for diagnosing and treating a host of health problems that currently present some of our greatest challenges. "

This important astronomical discovery ends decades of speculation about whether the planets of our solar system might be unusual or even unique. However, scientists are now faced with a number of other questions. How did these other planets form? And how might they compare with the ones we already know?Many of the newly found planets are extremely close to their stars. This had led to speculation that these planets have migrated to their orbits from further away. But how? Norman Murray has found a solution to this puzzle. His widely cited research on planetary formation has focused on the gravitational interaction between a large planet (the size of Jupiter or Saturn) and smaller (moon-sized) bodies. The gravitational interaction leads to the ejection of the smaller bodies, reducing, in the process, the size of the orbit of the large planet.As holder of a Canada Research Chair, Murray will examine the evidence collected about planets that are found orbiting other stars. These planets have been detected because they are large enough to affect the motion of the star. That means, however, that they are probably too big to host life as we know it. But as more is learned about how these planets behave, it should be possible to explore theories about how smaller planets form and whether they might also be present and detectable.As these theories are refined with new observations, Murray and his colleagues expect to make significant progress in answering the haunting question of whether humanity is alone in the universe. This work may not verify the actual existence of life on other planets, but it will go a long way toward showing us worlds much like our own in every other way. "

Many different cell types are involved in the immune response. T cells are a population of white blood cells that protect our bodies against infection. These cells also have the potential to protect our bodies against tumour cell growth. However, T cells can cause diseases, such as diabetes or arthritis, by attacking our own healthy tissues. There are numerous molecules that control the ability of T cells to attack germs, tumour cells and normal tissues. Much of the work by Canada Research Chair in Autoimmunity and Tumour Immunity, Dr. Pamela Ohashi, has focused on understanding the processes that initiate and direct an immune response to tumours or other tissues of the body. Identifying key molecules and pathways that control the immune response will provide new targets and ways to direct innovative therapies for cancer. The goal of the lab is to identify different ways to improve the size and length of time of an immune response, so that new approaches can be incorporated in treatments that trigger an immune response to cancer. Ohashi’s efforts will also establish the first team to provide T cell immune therapy for cancer patients. This will provide an important foundation for future efforts to combat cancer. "

Yet we are now on the verge of replacing it with something that promises to be even more revolutionary.Where transistors now make it possible to store and exchange information using electrons, the next generation of information technology components will carry out these processes with light. And they'll do the job much more efficiently, conducting volumes of data at speeds that would presently be impossible.The key to such progress lies with the discovery of new materials that can be designed, synthesized and manufactured to serve as the circuitry for light. Geoffrey Ozin has made it possible to use organic and inorganic molecules that self-construct such circuitry. His research introduced new controls over the way these molecules assemble themselves over multiple length scales, so they can be arranged in patterns designed to serve a particular purpose. In effect, Ozin is responsible for discovering how to build new classes of materials with optical properties that are specifically suited to the needs of information technology.As the holder of a Canada Research Chair, Ozin will be exploring the self-assembly, chemical synthesis, structure, properties and applications of photonic crystals. These are a new class of solid-state materials with a periodic structure organised on the scale of the wavelength of light. The structure and composition of photonic crystals are orchestrated to endow them with the unique ability to manage light as semiconductors handle electrons. Ozin will also be considering chemical patterning and micro-fabrication strategies for introducing special kinds of structural defects and intelligent guests into the resulting photonic crystals. They will be fashioned to create photonic crystals that localise, emit, switch, reflect, guide and bend light, having utility as micro-lasers, optical transistors and filters, and micro-optical circuits. Eventually, Ozin and his colleagues plan to integrate photonic crystals with optical fibres to produce the prototype of an all-optical microchip. The goal?

To expectant parents it's a terrifying thought. Yet respiratory problems-often first indicated by a weak or non-existent cry-are one of the major causes of disease and death for the 5 to 10 per cent of babies that are born premature.Helping immature lungs cope is an extremely complex medical challenge, one that Martin Post has been tackling prodigiously for the past 20 years. The new Canada Research Chair in Fetal, Neonatal, and Maternal Health, is a world leader in the basic research which is leading to improved neo-natal lung therapy.Treatment for immature lungs is most effective if it mimics normal lung development. But Post says in order to treat lungs this way, it's necessary to understand the mechanisms of fetal lung development. It's an understanding that he approaches from the microscopic level of cells and molecules.To date, researchers have identified only a small number of the exact chemical pathways that regulate lung cell development and organization, such as lung branching. Post's research will explore several so-called ""signalling pathways"" that are essential to normal lung development. These communication pathways involve the genes, proteins and cells involved in a particular aspect of lung development.Post's research will also tackle the critical role of mechanical forces in lung growth and development. Premature babies often require mechanical ventilation to breathe. However, young lungs can be injured by the pressure and volume of the air used. Post's research will be especially relevant because it will attempt to identify ways to avoid these injuries, while at the same time providing the lung with the benefits of movement.Thanks to the research chair, Post's basic research will continue and lead to valuable developments and improvements in health care and treatment. It has already spawned numerous therapeutic benefits. Prenatal steroid therapy to stimulate fetal lung maturation has been reduced as a result of his documenting the possible negative affects of this practise. He also holds a patent for a method that diagnoses an increased risk of pre-eclampsia, a potentially life-threatening disease, characterised by hypertension, that affects approximately 5 percent of pregnant women.

Photonics and nanotechnology take advantage of the fundamental behaviour of light inside novel ""designer"" materials. These intelligent structures-engineered at nanometer-length scales using the latest breakthroughs in chemistry and physics-are providing the foundation for an entirely new vision of information technology. The resulting devices could be millions of times faster and more powerful than even the most remarkable of today's computing hardware.Ted Sargent's research has brought this vision of the future into the present. He has created a new type of laser that unites many sophisticated optical devices onto a single, integrated photonic chip. His research links the emerging concept of the photonic circuit with the exploding field of fibre optic networks. Ted Sargent's breakthrough with the lateral current injection laser won him the 1999 NSERC Silver Medal. Sargent has also shown that a new kind of photonic macrocrystal-one which harnesses nature's underlying drive toward symmetry-will transform how communication networks are built. He works with novel materials that can be induced to organize themselves into specific arrays and patterns, spaced no further apart than the microscopic wavelength of the light which passed through them. He has also developed the photonic heterostructure, which takes advantage of the fact that photons-bundles of light energy-behave both as particles and waves.As the holder of a Canada Research Chair, Sargent, with his colleagues, will further advance the capacity of innovative nanostructured materials and devices to generate and respond to ultra-high speed streams of digital information. The team will harness the power of laser beams to create low-cost optical components with unprecedented performance.Sargent's photonics research is not only displacing the electron in computing and communication; it is revealing that these quantum particles-the electron and the photon-may together be exploited through deepened understanding of their fundamental interactions.

That's because it's here-the surface cells of the stomach, intestines, and colon-that your body wages a crucial battle against bacterial invaders. A cellular struggle that, for an infected person, can mean life or death.In order for these potentially harmful bacteria to actually cause disease, Sherman says they have to do more than just be ingested. The toxins produced by the bacteria have to enter a person's gastrointestinal cells. It's at this critical point of movement, from inside the gut to actually inside the tissues of the body, that Sherman hopes to provide a fortified front-line of defence.And while the deadly bacteria Sherman is tackling are only one cell large, they are formidable foes. These pathogenic bacteria trick intestinal wall cells into changing their shape. The result? Human cells become more susceptible to disease and substances produced by the bacteria. Sherman was among the first researchers in the world to demonstrate this microbial morphing ability in relation to human cells. His research focuses on two well-known bacterial pathogens: Helicobacter pylori and enterohemorragic Escherichia coli. They are microbes that affect the stomach and large bowel, respectively. Understanding the ways that these microbes alter human gut cells will allow researchers to develop new treatments, and possibly even vaccines to prevent infection.The water contamination in Walkerton, Ontario in the summer of 2000 made the potential deadly consequences of these gut bacterial infections front-page news all across Canada. In global terms, Sherman believes the Walkerton deaths were the tip of a very large iceberg. Every year, tens of thousands of people get sick and die from gastrointestinal bacterial diseases. Sherman hopes his research can help to make a significant dent in this figure. And knowing how these bacteria get their first foothold in the body will be a major step to preventing these deaths. "

How do nerve cells communicate? It's a basic research question that has potentially far-reaching implications for the understanding of all brain processing-from movement to emotion-and for understanding many degenerative and functional brain disorders like Alzheimer's, epilepsy and movement disorders.For the past 16 years, Elise has explored the intricate and complicated role that calcium plays in the transmission of impulses from a nerve cell to its many target cells at the often remote contact points called synapses. We can liken synapses to the brain's transistors, for they are specialized contacts that can transmit, amplify or damp the brain's electrical circuits. At the synapse, calcium, in its dissolved or ""ionic"" form, performs a role of crucial importance-it links electrical impulses in the nerve ending to the release of chemical ""transmitter"" substances. These transmitters act on the membranes of target cells, trigging them to fire their own impulses in turn.In 1989 and 1991, Stanley was the first person to record the movement of calcium through a molecular pore or ""calcium ion channel,"" into the nerve terminal. This was a most challenging task, as these nerve terminals are extraordinarily tiny, typically only 0.002 millimetres, and each calcium ion channel admits only about 150 individual calcium ions at a time. The experiment took three years to prepare, and has since opened the door to a new understanding of nerve function. As the new Canada Research Chair in Brain and Behaviour at the University of Toronto and the Head of the Cellular and Molecular Biology Division of the Toronto Western Research Institute, UHN, Elise will continue to investigate the role that calcium ions and calcium chanels play in nerve function and brain processing. A key goal is to examine how the calcium channels themselves are modulated. Such modulation can control the quantity of transmitter released from the nerve terminal and therefore how large an influence an individual nerve terminal has on brain activity. This control mechanism likely plays a fundamental role in many complex brain processes such as learning and memory. "

Those reactions were not predicted by animal tests or by clinical trials conducted on a relatively small numbers of patients. ""Old"" drugs can also cause life-threatening reactions. These reactions are a significant cause of death in Canada and the United States. To prevent idiosyncratic reactions, researchers need to understand how and why they occur. These reactions appear to involve the formation of chemically reactive metabolites that, in some patients, induce an immune response leading to the adverse reaction. Jack Uetrecht's lab has identified a large number of reactive metabolites in drugs, and has studied how they react with protein and how they induce an immune response. Although these reactions are also idiosyncratic in animals, he has found a few suitable animal models, one of which was discovered in his lab, to investigate factors that prevent these reactions. Working with the pharmaceutical company Merck, Uetrecht is using the company's gene chips to obtain a comprehensive view of changes in gene expression induced by drugs - first in animals, with a comparison between animals which have an adverse reaction and those that do not, and ultimately in humans. Uetrecht is also part of a multidisciplinary clinic that deals exclusively with adverse drug reactions and his research is a good example of research that goes from ""bench to bedside.""Awarding Uetrecht this research chair will help Canada seize its chance to become a world leader in drug safety.

This awkward situation could improve dramatically if we could simply grow new organs for these patients.Does this all sound like pure science fiction? Not at all. Peter Zandstra's work has demonstrated the astonishing ability of unspecialized cells (stem cells) to take on new functions as they multiply. Through the same biochemical process that turns each of us from a single cell into a newborn child, doctors could grow a new heart to replace a patient's damaged one.By the time a baby is born, that ability has yielded the kaleidoscope of different types of cells making up the human body, most of which are highly specialized and utterly distinct from one another. After birth, this dramatic flurry of diversification greatly subsides. Although cells with a significant developmental capacity live on in adults, under most circumstances, the body cannot harness this developmental potential.However, researchers like Zandstra are making it possible to employ this developmental capability of stem cells as a new way to address some challenging medical conditions. Such work focuses on blood stem cells, which are capable of producing all blood cell types and embryonic stem cells, which retain the potential to grow into any other type of cell found in the body. Cultivated in a laboratory, these cells could be used to grow a suitable replacement for various body tissues, such as the heart.This kind of cell cultivation, however, has proven difficult. Zandstra has contributed to our knowledge of how it could be accomplished. He has effectively described the role of substances that govern the growth and reproduction of stem cells. A broader understanding of these substances lays the foundation for techniques that could guide the cells to develop in specific ways, producing specific types of tissue desired for medical use.As the holder of a Canada Research Chair, Zandstra will investigate the best means of obtaining and growing stem cells. He will also explore the agents responsible for initiating and controlling the process of cell development. Ultimately, he foresees the development of technology necessary to construct clinical bioreactors, which will be capable of growing a wide range of different tissues from small populations of stem cells.

The relatively low temperatures used in LPEE and THM, and their ability to provide relatively well-controlled growth of crystals with the desired properties make these techniques technologically very promising.This objective can only be achieved through combined experimental and theoretical study, and through a sound understanding of the growth mechanisms of these crystal growth processes. Dr. Dost's research program incorporates these qualities, and includes three main components: modelling and numerical simulations, growth experiments, and characterization of grown crystals. Dr. Dost's collaborations with other researchers and scientists at the Centre for Advanced Materials and Related Technology (CAMTEC) - for which he is the Founding Director - promise to lead to significant developments in the fundamental knowledge of crystal growth and related advanced materials. Such materials will give considerable impetus to the relevant Canadian industry, and will, for instance, lead to small but reliable medical imaging devices that greatly improve the quality of life of Canadians.

Although the mathematical foundations are very old, the field has become one of increasing importance in the last twenty years. Part of this can be traced to advances in computational technology, but of equal importance is the discovery of the phenomenon now known as chaos and its pervasive role in nature. The study of dynamical systems has also played an important role in information theory and its application to information technology. Operator algebras were developed as a model for quantum mechanics in the early part of the last century. The seminal work of Murray and von Neumann demonstrated the close connections between this subject and dynamical systems.Dr. Ian F. Putnam, Canada Research Chair in Operator Algebras and Dynamical Systems, is recognized worldwide as a top expert on the interrelation of these two subjects. He is the leader of an international group of researchers who bring the powerful tools of modern operator algebra theory to the study of operator algebras associated to topological dynamical systems.Dr. Putnam will continue his explorations using the tools of Alain Connes' program of non-commutative geometry. The goal of Dr. Putnam's research is two-fold: to construct from dynamical systems new examples of C*-algebras and to apply the tools of non-commutative geometry to these C*-algebras to obtain new information about the dynamics. Some specific immediate areas of interest are the study of aperiodic order, topological orbit equivalence and Smale's program for hyperbolic (i.e. chaotic) dynamics from smooth systems.Dr. Putnam will be working closely with collaborators at the university and at the Pacific Institute for the Mathematical Sciences (PIMS), and plans to form a group of collaborators from among these and other institutions. With Dr. Putnam's appointment to this Chair, this group could soon become one of the strongest mathematical centres in Canada. "

The observed number of species in sediments suggests that a huge diversity could exist, but a coordinated program of exploration is required.Dr. Verena Tunnicliffe has established herself as one of the leading authorities on deep-water life, particularly associated with the hydrothermal vents on mid-ocean ridges and cold seeps on continental margins. Both types of formations are excellent ecosystems to address current issues in diversity regulation because of several distinct features.Dr. Tunnicliffe's research program will examine patterns of species distribution in the deep sea and processes that affect biodiversity. Animal communities of hydrothermal vents provide an unusually rich setting to study diversity. Dr. Tunnicliffe will focus on two key objectives. The first will be to define the major diversity regulating mechanisms in marine benthic communities. The second objective is to assess responses in diversity of benthic and hyperbenthic faunal communities to predictable/seasonal processes in the upper ocean, and unpredictable food inputs and upper ocean events.New techniques in deep-sea research will be developed through the establishment of the Victoria Experimental Network UnderSea (VENUS) observatory. This underwater array of fibre optic cables will connect instruments placed at strategic nodes to the scientist ashore. The array will be deployed in water channels between Vancouver Island and the mainland where a team of researchers will investigate water column, seafloor and sub-seafloor phenomena. Using VENUS, Dr. Tunnicliffe's team and other ocean scientists will be able to observe remote events as they happen and initiate sampling or experimentation in response. "

Canada is a leader in many global environmental initiatives, including bio-diversity, forestry and climate change, and faces key ongoing decisions about trade with the United States regarding such issues as softwood lumber, water and hydro-electric power. Given those realities, it is clear that Canada's decision-makers stand to benefit from environmental and resource economics research that is conducted in concert with the work of other researchers in the field. Climate science often ignores economic considerations, and climate models do not usually include interactive economic sectors, making it difficult to explore cost-effective policy responses to climate change and its consequences.Dr. G. Cornelis van Kooten is widely recognized as a leader in devising effective economic measures for analyzing various aspects of the environment, and his seven-year plan as Canada Research Chair in Environmental Studies and Climate Change will allow him to apply his techniques to a wide range of issues. While his plan is designed to accommodate issues that arise between now and 2009, its initial focus will be on two principal areas: economics of climate change; and forest economics and policy analysis.The University of Victoria has one of the world's three large-scale models for developing the science of climate change, and Dr. van Kooten will work in an interdisciplinary setting to study the economic factors related to such topics as: land use; carbon offsets; water use; energy; and forestry.Although forestry is an important sector in the Canadian economy, academic work is not commensurate with this profile. Dr. van Kooten's work will strengthen this area by examining topics such as: trade in forest products; certification of forest practices and products; and forest policy and the new institutional economics.

If that water is contaminated, it poses a serious risk to human health. Because aquifers carry groundwater downstream to lakes and rivers, groundwater contamination also threatens surface water quality. As Canada Research Chair in Groundwater Remediation, Dr. David Blowes is developing new approaches to predicting, preventing, and remediating groundwater contamination. Blowes and his research team are conducting field studies to develop detailed descriptions of mine sites where groundwater has been contaminated by dissolved metals and metalloids. They are also conducting laboratory studies to develop design parameters for building permeable reactive barrier (PRB) systems (underground barriers that intercept and react to contaminants in groundwater), as well as field studies to examine the effectiveness of PRB systems. Although Blowes has had significant success in developing PRBs in the past, their long-term effectiveness is still unclear. For this reason, he and his team are also developing new analytical tools to evaluate the efficiency, effectiveness, and limitations of PRB technology. Blowes also uses computer models to simulate the release, transport, and attenuation of dissolved metals at mine sites as well as the performance of passive groundwater remediation systems. By gaining a better understanding of groundwater contamination—and developing tools to prevent and deal with it when it does happen—Blowes hopes to better protect and restore groundwater quality in the future.

But the constant scaling down that enabled this revolution is reaching its limit. Our current “classical” silicon technologies are approaching the scale of atoms and molecules. At this scale, the laws of quantum mechanics start to dictate the behaviour of systems, and classical architectures no longer suffice. But this apparent barrier is, in fact, an incredible opportunity. By harnessing the power of quantum mechanics, we can produce novel systems that outperform their classical counterparts. Quantum information processors promise astounding improvements in efficiency on a range of applications in computing, communications and security. Quantum devices will include sensors that operate at the ultimate sensitivities allowed by the laws of the universe.

It sounds ridiculous, but computer users and data transmission servers do this kind of thing every day.Most data files are stored or transmitted without being compressed. As large hard drives with vast memory capacity have become commonplace, computer users overlook the fact they're wasting valuable space. Data transmission has also sped up dramatically, thanks to the advent of fibre optic networks, but they, too, carry the data equivalent of a shipment of inflated balloons.Dr. En-hui Yang is co-developer of the Yang-Kieffer algorithm, a numerical set of rules employing grammar-based coding to achieve lossless compression of text and image files. Compression programs applying this technique can take the ""air"" out of ""data balloons"" and then ""re-inflate"" them to their exact original size and shape - that's essentially what lossless compression and de-compression is all about. The process outperforms all other existing methods by several orders of magnitude.Dr. Yang's outstanding and novel contribution to the field of data compression and information theory is being recognized by his appointment to a Canada Research Chair. The next phase of Dr.Yang's research is aimed, in part, at developing ways to compress huge multimedia files with as high efficiency as possible.

The key to understanding how our brains work and what goes wrong when our senses fail us has been right before - and behind - our eyes all along. Over half of our cerebral cortex (the seat of higher brain functions) is devoted to vision. Scientists postulate that the neural processes used to transform visual information into actions (such as movement) are central to brain function. Understand them and you unlock the mysteries of the brain while opening a diagnostic window onto the enigma that is neurological disease.The implications of studying eye-hand coordination are not lost on Douglas Crawford. His discoveries of the rules that govern 3-D rotations of the eye, head and arm have placed him and his research team at the forefront of neurophysiological science. Their findings have been recognized internationally as major contributions to our understanding of motor control.By using sophisticated scanning technologies such as MRI, they have followed visual signals as they pass from the eye through to the visual center of the brain. They have watched as neurons fired and limbs responded, and have identified the neural mechanisms responsible for motor commands based on visual cues. Still, their research is only in its early stages.The continuing research at York University's Centre for Vision Research will expand knowledge of hand-eye coordination, perception, and motor control.

It is also understood that regular exercise can generate mitochondria, the components of human cells that produce about 90 percent of the cellular energy (ATP) requirements. This is significant because when mitochondrial content is low in a cell or if dysfunction exists - as in mitochondrial disease - ATP synthesis is reduced and cell survival is compromised. Although the positive benefits of regular physical activity on the synthesis of mitochondria within muscle cells are well established, a large number of questions exist regarding the mechanisms through which mitochondrial biogenesis occurs.Dr. David Hood believes these questions are essential from both a basic science point of view and because the answers will enhance the understanding of the basis for an increasing number of mitochondrially-based disorders, in addition to understanding the role of regular exercise in reversing mitochondrial disease and/or cell death (apoptosis).It is well recognized that many diseases - including muscular, neurological, metabolic and heart diseases - have origins based on mitochondrial dysfunction, due to a defect in respiration and ATP production.Dr. Hood's lab is unique in that it is devoted to understanding both the molecular aspects of exercise-induced mitochondrial biogenesis in skeletal muscle and the direct application of exercise to the understanding and amelioration of mitochondrial disorders and mitochondrially- driven cell death.His research program has six objectives over a five-year period, including the investigation of nuclear and mitochondrial gene transcription, the mechanisms of protein transport into mitochondria, understanding the types of signals contracting muscles send, an evaluation of how exercise-induced mitochondrial biogenesis affects cell death, and the development of a collaborative group on skeletal muscle health.

His particular interest is focused on a group of proteases called cathepsins, which play a critical role in musculoskeletal, respiratory and cardiovascular diseases.Many proteases are considered as potential drug targets for a large variety of diseases. By improving the knowledge of how proteases work and finding novel drugs inhibiting proteases, Dr. Brömme’s research could lead to new treatments for degenerative and inflammatory disorders. "

Therapy patients of often feel safer in a virtual reality environment, which can be more confidential and less costly than conventional settings, while giving the therapist more control. Some studies have shown that, for several psychological disorders, virtual reality treatment and prevention are just as effective as those delivered in a conventional setting. Dr. Stéphane Bouchard, Canada Research Chair in Clinical Cyberpsychology, is studying the effectiveness of treating anxiety disorders in a virtual reality setting. To better understand the therapeutic tools at work in this setting, he is testing whether people with anxiety disorders can change the mental representations encoded in their memory, leading to more effective psychotherapy treatment. Bouchard has already proven that telepsychotherapy is an effective treatment for agoraphobia and panic disorder, and he is now studying the effectiveness of treating anxiety disorders through distance treatment programs like video-conferencing.Bouchard’s research will enable him to identify the factors that influence cyberpsychology therapeutic processes, reduce the costs of dedicated virtual environments for therapeutic purposes, and to give more people access to this kind of psychological treatment.

For twenty years, Dr. Peter Loewen has studied oxidative stress, the demands put on a cell by any species capable of causing oxidative damage. As Canada Research Chair in Protein Chemistry, Dr. Loewen will focus on catalase - the family of enzymes that are capable of breaking down hydrogen peroxide to oxygen and water - with the objective of determining how the structure of catalase influences hydrogen peroxide degradation, as well as investigating other mechanisms of oxidative stress response.The specific goal of Dr. Loewen's research will be to continue the characterization of factors that protect bacteria against oxidative stress. This will involve the characterization of protein structure-function relationships in stress response proteins. Within this broad goal, his three key objectives are to analysis of structure-function relationships in hydroperoxidase II, one of two catalases produced by E. coli bacteria, with particular focus on characterizing solute flow in the enzyme; analysis of the structure and structure-function relationships in catalase-peroxidases; and characterization of the role of the DNA binding regulatory protein PerR in mediating stationary phase peroxide resistance.The research will lead to a greater understanding of the function of stress response proteins, and the definition of a new mechanism involving solute flow through the protein for the catalase enzyme, in its role as a key protective agent against hydrogen peroxide. Dr. Loewen's research program will train highly qualified personnel in the area of structural biology and protein chemistry. Overall, the program will address the need for characterization of thousands of proteins that have been identified through genomics and proteomics. "

They are used by freeze-resistant organisms (fish and insects) to lower their freezing point, and by freeze-tolerant organisms (plants and bacteria) to lessen freezing damage by inhibiting ice recrystallization. These properties make AFPs of considerable interest in cryobiology, frozen foods or frost protection of crops. However, many details of the absorption-inhibition mechanism are not yet understood. For example, do AFPs really bind irreversibly to ice? If so, why is there concentration dependence for antifreeze activity? What is the extent of surface coverage by AFPs? Dr. Peter L. Davies is embarking on a series of experiments to address these fascinating problems, using specially designed equipment and modified AFPs. He and his team have a working hypothesis for how AFPs bind to ice, and are now entering a phase where they aim to manipulate antifreeze activity. With enough knowledge about AFP structure-function, Dr. Davies is also in a position to begin de novo design. This is not only the best test of their understanding of how AFPs work, but also an opportunity to make inexpensive biological antifreezes for biotechnological applications. Another area of Dr. Davies' research is in the structure, function and mechanism of calpains, which are intracellular Ca2+-dependent cysteine proteases that mediate Ca2+ signalling. Their job is to cut specific proteins where there is a local burst of Ca2+ released into the cell. When Ca2+ levels go out of control after stroke, heart attack and during neurodegeneration, calpain hyperactivity causes widespread tissue damage. For this reason, calpains are important targets for drug design. Dr. Davies' vision is that we will become so good at understanding the structure-function relationships in proteins that we will be increasingly able to redesign and newly design proteins for specific purposes, and so realize the potential of protein engineering.

For example, laptop computer screens rely on liquid crystals to display information, semiconductors for their integrated circuits, and intercalation compounds for their batteries. Discovering materials with enhanced properties and developing better processing methods for these materials rests on advancing research in materials science. In 1995, the development of Combinatorial Material Synthesis (CMS) revolutionized materials science research. Unlike more traditional methods, which synthesize and design new materials one by one, CMS can uncover hundreds, even thousands, of distinct compositions in a single experiment, vastly accelerating the time it takes to test new material performance and properties. Dr. Jeffery R. Dahn, a world leader in CMS experimentation, has developed novel CMS-based processes to improve lithium-ion battery electrodes materials and fuel cell catalysts. He boasts the only laboratory in Canada and one of very few in the world equipped with an entire suite of CMS instrumentation for screening these materials. Dr. Dahn and his experienced team are now expanding their capabilities to tackle specific materials problems related to lithium-ion batteries and fuel cells, and to study other materials problems beyond these two power sources.Lithium-ion batteries are small rechargeable power sources for electronics that store more energy per unit mass or volume than any other battery technology. The team wants to increase the energy density of these batteries so that power supplies can be further miniaturized, and improve the safety of battery cells subjected to thermal or electrical abuse in order to produce larger cells, including cells large enough to power electric vehicles. Current fuel cell catalysts - chemicals that accelerate the reaction between oxygen, protons and electrons - generally incorporate expensive metals such as platinum. Dr. Dahn and his team will collaborate with 3M to develop novel catalysts that require fewer of these materials. "

Several of these processes use plasma, which provides a medium for carrying out processes that would be difficult, if not impossible, to carry out in conventional physical or chemical mediums. The research conducted by Dr. Mohamed Chaker at the INRS-Énergie, Matériaux et Télécommunications, will have two main thrusts. He will study plasma used for material synthesis and etching, and integrate these micro- and nano-manufacturing processes to develop radio frequency and photonic components. Dr. Chaker has been a professor at the INRS-Énergie, Matériaux et Télécommunications since 1989. As an expert on laser-produced plasma, he has an impressive record of accomplishments in the areas of laser-produced plasma for X-ray generation and its applications to X-ray and EUV lithography, laser-produced plasma for new material synthesis and high-density plasma for material etching. The first component of his research, the synthesis of materials by laser-produced plasma, will focus on the influence of laser pulse duration (subpicosecond to a nanosecond) on the synthesis of metallic silicides, of high dielectric constant materials and of photonic materials. This component will also incorporate a study of high-density plasma etching for producing patterns on the nanoscale. The second focus of the research program is on the production of ferro-electric RF components as well as electro-optical photonic components. Dr. Chaker's research will contribute to ongoing advanced plasma research, help improve micro- and nano-manufacturing processes, and integrate this micro- and nano-structure technology with the development of innovative RF and photonic components.

Chemical biology covers a wide range of scientific approaches, but leading researcher Dr. Scott Bohle defines it as the effort to discover new chemistry by understanding the biochemical logic of complex biological systems. One way to link chemistry to biology is through combinatorial chemistry, a research field that is routinely used by industry to discover new drugs and develop new catalysts. Its origins are based on perspectives of how the immune system works. In the immune system a small set of genes can be scrambled by application of a small set of rules, resulting in the generation of an enormous number of antibodies. New drugs and catalysts have been generated using this same approach in the laboratory. Dr. Bohle's current program focuses on applying the principles of chemical biology to increase understanding of nitric oxide biochemistry and the basis of action of the drugs used to treat malaria. He and his team have already made significant strides in these two areas. Nitric oxide helps maintain blood pressure, aids neural communication and controls infection. Among Dr. Bohle's contributions to understanding the chemistry behind this critical biology was the isolation of peroxynitrite, a key by-product from nitric oxide generation. His team also solved an age-old problem in malaria - understanding how the malaria parasite adapts to living inside red blood cells - by using the techniques of modern solid state physics to uncover the structure of the key haemoglobin metabolite (malaria pigment). Dr. Bohle is convinced that this fundamental discovery will increase understanding of how most well-established antimalarial drugs function. In turn, this knowledge should allow them to enhance the effectiveness of these drugs in reducing or preventing malaria, which is currently rampant in many countries. Dr. Bohle's latest program will have many practical outcomes and promises to reveal the remarkable chemistry of ostensibly simple molecules. "

At the same time, their influence on the development of societies worldwide has also increased, and there is growing need for new generations to master technologies in order to achieve social and academic success. It appears inevitable that knowing how to self-educate, learn, and communicate using a range of technologies will be required skills for adapting to an ever-changing society, and for becoming a full participant in society. Dr. Thierry Karsenti, Canada Research Chair on Technologies in Education, will address this compelling social issue by improving understanding about the use and impacts of technology in education, from the standpoints of both learners and teachers. Since technologies also make education more polymorphic, he believes it is especially important to study a variety of educational settings in which technologies are used, particularly in cases where distance learning is combined with more traditional teaching practices. Karsenti’s chair program will address the following five research areas: technologies and teaching: training, insertion, intervention and professional development; technologies and skills development: uses and impacts for learners; emerging technologies and innovations: current and future issues for education; technologies, distance learning and mobile learning at universities; and technologies and research methods in the social sciences.

The product promotion strategy to be studied is the offer of price-matching guarantees by retailers. Price-matching appears to be pro-competitive, but analysts argue that it leads to collusion to set high prices and disadvantages consumers. Dr. Winter will test the incentives for price-matching guarantees as information conveyance in markets where consumers must otherwise invest time in active price comparisons.

This is because the cost of replacing existing low capacity copper wires and coaxial cables with high speed fibre optics is extremely high. This so-called ""broadband access problem"" is the most critical challenge facing the next-generation Internet. Dr. Wei Yu is undertaking research focused specifically on this critical problem. He intends to develop efficient, high capacity communication techniques based on a fundamental understanding of information theory and test them on existing wireless access networks and wired infrastructures. His research will address some of the most fundamental theoretical issues in digital communications and solve practical problems related to widely adopted industry standards, such as the wireless local area network standard, the digital subscriber line standard, and the Gigabit Ethernet standard. His discoveries promise to uncover cost effective solutions for tackling many important and long-standing challenges related to the broadband access problem.

His work has involved investigation of statistical mechanics problems through the use of theoretical modelling. This is of potential practical relevance since discovery and fundamental understanding of novel phenomena can lead to radical advances in existing technologies, or to the development of entirely new technologies.His research program will extend his prior work into the extreme sensitivity to thermal and quantum fluctuations, as well as to random impurities, exhibited by magnetic oxide materials.

This is affecting economic growth in this region. For example, rural water shortages have contributed to dramatic rural population declines in the last 50 years, poor water quality makes many supplies unusable, and increasing demand in some large urban areas is reaching the limit of allocations. Predictions of future climate changes and an increased demand for water will make unsustainable demands on these resources. In order to mitigate adverse effects and adapt to future changes, we must gain a better understanding of how climate and land use interact with water resources, and how to predict water supply and flooding in the Prairies with reduced uncertainty.Dr. John Pomeroy's research will address water resource and related climate issues that are critical to managing the environment and sustaining society in western and northern Canada. His three specific objectives are to improve assessments of water supply variability, understand the interactions between hydrological and atmospheric processes, and understand the interactions between hydrology and water quality.His research will focus on the dry and cold lands in western and northern Canada where many temperate zone hydrological technologies are proving inappropriate for local water management issues. In these regions, persistent water shortages occur, and snow accumulation and melt result in unique water management possibilities as well as destructive spring floods.Dr. Pomeroy is concentrating on six key themes including the effects of variable climate on water supply; development of a Prairie hydrology model; an improved description of the interactions between the atmosphere and snow; cold land hydrological processes; snowmelt flooding; and release of snow contaminants to the environment.This program will collaborate with partners from the federal and provincial governments, international agencies and researchers at the university, and will rely on intensive field studies to develop sound theories and models.

If it is to survive and prosper in the future, our paper industry needs new technologies that can fully exploit the Canadian fibre resource and, at the same time, protect the environment. Although extraordinary advances in computer control and polymer science have helped to transform the rather simple 1950s mechanical processing technology into modern-day science-based paper manufacturing, Dr. Robert H. Pelton believes much more can be done. Emerging developments in biotechnology are allowing him to tackle four sets of groundbreaking projects focused on exploiting the specificity of biological macromolecules to enhance papermaking. First he will screen a broad range of commercially available proteins to understand how specific protein structures influence adhesion in wet and dry composites, and will develop novel proteins for paper chemistry applications. Next, he will elucidate the relationships between protein structure, adsorption and flocculation (retention) efficiency. The third set of projects will try to harness the ability of molecules to self-assemble in order to transport target molecules to specific domains.

For example, data on the expression levels of genes in different cell types is currently advancing our understanding of fundamental biological processes, with many practical applications inmedicine and other fields.Dr. Radford Neal's research aims to support this developing mode of scientific research by addressing the statistical and computational challenges of handling complex models and large data sets. His research focuses on the Bayesian approach to statistics, in which conclusions are drawn by first specifying how likely various possibilities are based on previous (prior) information, and then updating the probabilities of these different possibilities in the light of new data.One aspect of his research is exploring new mathematical methods for specifying prior information about complex processes with hundreds or thousands of parameters. One problem with existing methods is that they often fail to capture the hierarchical structure of the problem. Dr. Neal is presently working on methods that use hidden tree structures to deal with this.Dr. Neal is also working on computational methods for updating prior information to account for data, particularly Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, which are the only feasible way of doing Bayesian inference for many complex models. These methods explore the possibilities bysimulating a random process that prefers to visit points combining high prior probability with good fit to the data. Many random processes of this sort are possible and Dr. Neal aims to find those which are both more efficient and easier to use. Dr. Neal's previous work spans the fields of Bayesian statistics and machine learning.

This is the focus of Dr. Caroline Palmer's research as Canada Research Chair in Cognitive Neuroscience of Performance.Dr. Palmer is an expert in human performance, music perception and quantitative/computational modelling with broad training in music, statistics, speech science, and in clinical and cognitive psychology. Her research is focused on two long-term objectives-identifying memory and motor processes that underlie accurate and fast performance in a variety of behaviours, and determining the cognitive changes that occur as people acquire skills. This program includes four main projects. First, Dr. Palmer is extending her earlier work on how the temporal properties of recalled events influence memory, such as which syllable in a word or which note in a melody lasts longer. The second focus is to further evaluate changes that occur in the brain as individuals acquire and develop musical skills. A third focus is on determining the relationship between memory retrieval and motor movements that occur as an individual performs complex tasks. Finally, Dr. Palmer is investigating how people with little or no musical training can predict upcoming events in temporally fluctuating music or speech.Increasing our understanding of the brain's role in shaping performance, memory and motor skills in the areas of speech and music provides valuable insight into the various learning techniques that work best for children and adults, as well as for novices and experts.

Conversely, abnormalities in the synaptic regulation of neuronal activity can lead to neurological diseases, such as epilepsy and psychiatric diseases, such as schizophrenia.Dr. Brian MacVicar's work focuses on examining how astrocytes modify neuronal activity, as well as the roles of secondary messenger pathways in the brain for modifying synaptic transmission.Dr. MacVicar's past research has provided him with significant expertise in advanced imaging. His current program will combine multi-photon laser scanning microscopy - employed to image brain slices - with whole cell patch recording to gain an accurate image of the synaptic activity that occurs deep in the brain.His research will follow three themes.First, he will examine how the modulation of neuron activity relates to increases in the amount of calcium in astrocytes. Related to this is further exploration of a discovery that calcium increases in astrocytes can induce contractions of small arterioles in brain slices. The research will look at the interplay between astrocytes and both the vasculature and the adjacent neurons.The second theme involves examination of how the activity of dendrites is affected by dopamine and acetylcholine - two key chemical neuromodulators that have significant impact in the regulation of behaviour and learning.The third theme will involve exploration of the roles for the mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinase family in the regulation of synaptic efficacy, which is of fundamental importance in the establishment of memory and learning in the central nervous system. In earlier work, Dr. MacVicar discovered that p38 - a MAP kinase - plays a critical role in intracellular signalling. New research will be conducted into the roles for intracellular second messenger pathways in modifying synaptic transmission. "

The majority of CF patients suffer from chronic pulmonary infections, caused by the bacterium known as P. aeruginosa, which cannot be treated successfully and generally have fatal outcomes. Dr. Joseph S. Lam believes that by investigating pathogen-host interactions he can develop more effective ways to target and treat these deadly infections.Dr. Lam is one of the world's leading experts in the molecular biology of the pathogen, P. aeruginosa. Over the past 18 years, his laboratory efforts have focused on how lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is synthesized and assembled as a surface coat. Since research has shown that LPS is a potent inflammatory stimulator that causes increased mucous production and damage to lung tissues in CF patients, understanding how to shut down its production should aid in the development of new therapies.Dr. Lam's team has already made significant progress in advancing fundamental knowledge about LPS and in identifying several key enzymes required to produce this surface coat. Thanks to funding from his Canada Research Chairs, Dr. Lam and his team can purchase state-of-the-art equipment to probe further into this critical area. The team will use an innovative multi-disciplinary approach involving genetics, biochemistry and chemical methods to achieve their objectives. The first focus of research will seek to define the enzyme function for each step of the LPS biosynthesis pathway. Once that is completed, they will investigate mechanisms of enzyme-substrate reactions and the structural biology of key enzymes with a view to developing novel antibiotics. This important research will provide an excellent training ground for postdoctoral fellows and graduate students who will benefit from Dr. Lam's expertise and that of the many internationally renowned scientists who are collaborating with him.

Many microbial genomes are now known, as are the genomes of humans, mice, round worms, fruitflies and others. The characterization of many more genomes, representing a wide variety of species, is either underway or in the planning. The importance of comparing genomes will increase as new data becomes available, and as genome data becomes easier to obtain. For medicine, an improved understanding of animal model systems can lead to better approaches to human diseases, but equally important is that the use of comparative approaches leads to an improved understanding of the mechanisms of change that exist within the genome.Dr. Ben Koop's research focuses on the study of molecular evolution. His objectives include understanding the role of gene duplication or deletion and gene families in the evolution of species, the role of genetic variation and mutation in health and disease, and developing new techniques, strategies and computer analyses to explore genetic systems and relate them to biochemical and physiological functions.His work breaks down into three projects.The first targets gene families and the mechanisms of evolutionary change, with an emphasis on gene families in the immune system, a unique gene-rich region that is associated with a variety of genetic disorders (7q22), and the salmon genome that has recently been duplicated.His second project involves examination of genetic variation and conservation of a wide variety of vertebrate populations that inhabit the coast of British Columbia. In particular, Dr. Koop focuses on wolves, dogs native to America, bears, martens, caribou, owls, salmon and sturgeon.The third project addresses technology development and the incorporation of computer analysis into the assessment and annotation of population and genomic information.

As Canada Research Chair in Lactic Cultures Biotechnology for Dairy and Probiotic Industries, Dr. Denis Roy is focusing on the manufacturing of dairy products, and how molecular microbiology can be used to study of microbial communities in foods.Roy’s work will be to increase knowledge about microbial cultures that can be used in the production of food, to understand how they function, and to investigate their properties and potential health benefits. Roy applies molecular methodologies to micro-organisms to define their diversity and measure their gene expression. This will simplify the task of identifying strains of bacteria, and of selecting the most effective strains with respect to food.Roy’s research work will undoubtedly help to improve the quality of food and to scientifically validate the benefits attributed to probiotics.

Neurological diseases may be genetically determined, caused by environmental factors, or some combination of the two. Various transmissible infectious agents may also play a role. The way viruses interact with the immune and nervous systems at the molecular and cellular level, and the impact this has on the development of inflammatory neurological diseases, is an important, yet somewhat neglected, area of study. Since the origins of a number of neurological diseases - including multiple sclerosis (MS), Parkinson's and Alzheimer's - are unknown, the possible links to infectious pathogens and immune reactions hold enormous potential for the development of novel preventive, therapeutic and diagnostic strategies. Dr. Pierre Talbot's area of focus is coronaviruses, which are responsible for up to one-third of the common colds that affect humans. Coronaviruses have been implicated in MS-type disease in genetically susceptible rodents, and Dr. Talbot's lab has shown that they can infect cells of the human nervous system, persist in human brains and activate potentially harmful white blood cells in MS patients. Dr. Talbot's research program has three major themes. The first is the characterization of cellular and molecular parameters of human coronavirus infection and its persistence in the nervous system, as well as inflammatory neuropathological mechanisms. The second theme is the characterization at the molecular level of T-cell cross-reactivity between human coronaviruses and two major myelin antigens. Finally, Dr. Talbot will characterize the molecular and cellular mechanisms of antibody neutralization of coronaviruses, as a possible intervention strategy as well as a general model for understanding antiviral immune neutralization. Overall, Dr. Talbot's program will enhance the likelihood of significant contributions to describing potentially pathologically relevant novel aspects of virus interactions with the immune and nervous systems, as well as providing novel data on virus neutralizations.

This biological phenomenon of antimicrobial resistance has snowballed into a serious public health concern, with economic, social and political implications that are global in scale. Studies of resistance mechanisms are important because they permit the development of tools for the early recognition of resistance in infection, thus preventing useless or toxic chemotherapy; they suggest more rational uses of drugs and drug combinations, minimizing the development of resistance; and they pinpoint intra-cellular drug targets and defence mechanisms, allowing the development of drug analogues that circumvent the most common defences.Dr. Marc Ouellette has focused throughout his career on the puzzle of antimicrobial resistance, and his work has led to a number of important developments. His current research is concentrated on achieving a better definition of the mechanisms of resistance for two important pathogens, the parasite Leishmania and the bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae.A protozoan parasite that is endemic in 88 countries, Leishmania affects some 12 million people, with up to two million new cases each year. Transmitted by sand flies into animal hosts, the parasite can lead to a number of diseases and has affected foxhounds in both the United States and Ontario. No vaccines are available, and the chemotherapeutic arsenal is limited. New drug targets are urgently required. Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most important bacterial pathogen of the respiratory tract in both adults and children, resulting in significant levels of illness and death. Drug resistant bacteria are now frequently encountered, and finding alternative therapies is among the top priorities of the World Health Organization.It is anticipated that Dr. Ouellette's work will lead to the identification of many novel pathways and potential therapeutic and diagnostic targets.

Composed of proteins called connexins, gap junctions allow a variety of small molecules to pass freely from cell to cell, ensuring that the cells coordinate their responses to various signals. Disruptions in gap junction coupling have been detected in some cancers and these channels appear to be involved in epilepsy and stroke. Mutations in connexin genes can result in various inherited diseases, including nervous system disorders, deafness, cataracts, heart defects and skin diseases. A leading figure in gap junction research, Dr. Christian Naus will use genetically altered mice to conduct a research program to explore the role of gap junctions in neural development and disease, including consequences of connexin mutations on gap junction structure and function. His research in developmental neuroscience will examine the function of gap junction coupling in the developing brain. The role of gap junctions in association with neurological disorders will be examined in mouse models and with clinical tissues related to stroke, epilepsy and brain cancer. In the areas of cell biology and cancer research, Dr. Naus will seek to determine the mechanisms underlying the tumor-suppressor function that gap junctions play, and the link between gap junctions and the expression of growth-control genes. He will also explore the range of endogenous molecules that pass through gap junction channels, some of which are likely to be involved in the control of cell growth and differentiation.

His new program of work is directed at translating the emerging knowledge into the prevention and management of breast and ovarian cancer.His program is divided into four research themes.Dr. Narod's first task is to identify gene/environment interactions in hereditary breast cancer. He will track approximately 5,000 women who carry the genetic mutation. The risk of breast cancer will be correlated with predictive factors and the information will be used to identify potential modifiers of cancer risk in this high risk group.The second phase will focus specifically on preventive oophorectomy - removal of one or both ovaries. Because women who carry a mutation of BRCA1 have a lifetime risk of approximately 40 percent of developing ovarian cancer, prevention of the disease in these women is critically important. Current prevention techniques include oral contraceptives, tubal ligation and prophylactic oophorectomy, but the latter carries with it some impairment of quality of life. The purpose of Dr. Narod's study is to evaluate the impact of prophylactic surgical oophorectomy on the lives of 300 women over a five-year period. In addition to assessing quality of life issues, the study will measure the level of risk reduction of ovarian and peritoneal cancer, and establish whether the risk reduction is related to the age of the surgery, the surgical procedure, previous use of oral contraceptives and/or tubal ligation.In his third phase of research, Dr. Narod will seek to identify the relationship of several treatment factors - including surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy and the drug tamoxifen - to selected outcomes in women with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations.Finally, Dr. Narod will calculate the risk of developing breast cancer for non-carriers, with regard to age, family history and the degree of relationship from affected women.

His new program expands that work, examining the predictors of short- and long-term multi-dimensional outcomes, especially potentially malleable predictors, such as treatment delay, cognition, and the nature and delivery of initial treatment. Using his Prevention and Early Intervention for Psychosis Program model and results from his longitudinal study started in 1999 in London, Ontario, Dr. Malla will develop the necessary infrastructure at Montreal's Douglas Hospital Research Centre to establish a longitudinal database of new cases of first-episode psychosis and further investigate service models and new medical and psychosocial treatments for preventing relapses and improving long-term outcome. He will also compare the impact of different methods of early community case identification (identifying cases in a community rather than in a hospital or clinical setting) on outcome. Dr. Malla will collaborate with researchers at McGill to expand his research to include neurobiological and epidemiological methods in early psychosis and the pre-psychotic period. Through longitudinal study of early psychosis, the role of malleable versus non-malleable predictors of outcome can be examined.

Although it has enabled our high-tech society to communicate across the world with relative ease, our appreciation of power of photonics is still in its infancy. For advanced optical processing, it is often necessary to influence properties such as the phase and amplitude of photons. An elegant approach involves the use of a semi-infinitely long diffractive device. Dr. Raman Kashyap has some creative and original ideas on how to create these diffractive devices in two and three dimensions and also how to make them ""tuneable."" The ability of these diffractive devices to be tuneable makes them invaluable to researchers who are desperately in need of solutions for all optical transparent communication networks. Dr. Kashyap's research has led him into the field of photonic band-gap materials, also known as photonic crystals, in which ""artificial"" structures are created to modify how light is entrapped. For example, in these perfect artificial structures, light may not be allowed to escape, leading to a compact optical memory function, which is a highly desirable function for a vast number of applications in medicine, communications and computer storage, and one which increases our technological capability by orders of magnitude. Connections have always played a significant part in Dr. Kashyap's reality. For example, he invented a method for making infinitely long diffractive devices in optical fibre, by recognizing the infinite movement of a point on the surface of a rotating wheel.

He is also co-general editor of a 25-volume edition of the Works and Correspondence of Samuel Richardson and is beginning work on a new biography of Jane Austen. The Centre has already produced sixteen volumes of Burney journals and letters and is launching a new Burney project: a six-volume edition of Burney’s Court Journals and Letters (1786-1791). Burney’s journals provide vivid accounts of daily life during the era. They detail King George III's first period of mental derangement and also include extensive reports of the impeachment trial of Warren Hastings, the Governor General of India. By preparing modern, complete and unabridged scholarly editions of Burney’s journals and letters, this research is expanding the knowledge of 18th-century literature and life. "

That was a key finding of the Ontario Child Health Study, which was carried out in 1983 and was the first large-scale observational study of children in families in Canada. For many researchers, clinicians and community organizations, an important way to reduce these problems is to understand the adverse effects of socioeconomic disadvantage-and then to develop policy and programs to offset them. Providing information to help guide decisions on allocating resources is occupying much of Michael Boyle's time as the Canada Research Chair in the Social Determinants of Child Health. He is analyzing outcomes for children who are participating in the Ontario Child Health Study as well as other large population-based child development studies. These analyses are quantifying the long-term adverse effects of socioeconomic status on children's health. They are also helping to identify the characteristics of families, communities and nations that mute those effects. Boyle hopes to conduct an international comparative study of child health and the impacts of social, economic and cultural forces on children and their families. He expects that his work will provide information that will help others advocate for the right of children to healthy lives. The results of his work will also guide decision makers in allocating Canada's foreign aid resources to children and families in the developing world. Finally, his research will help establish Canada as a world leader in the study of child health and development. "

Despite this, VHDs are not well understood, and no medical treatment is currently available to slow their progression. Aortic stenosis (AS), the most common type of VHD, is a slowly progressive heart disorder that leads to the calcification and obstruction of the heart’s aortic valve. Once the patient develops severe AS, the only effective treatment is to replace the diseased aortic valve with a prosthetic one. As Canada Research Chair in Valvular Heart Diseases, Dr. Phillippe Pibarot and his research team are looking at the link between abdominal obesity and AS in hopes of finding ways to prevent and treat it. They are investigating whether certain lifestyle changes, such as a better diet and more physical activity, coupled with new drugs, can help slow or even block the progression of AS and avoid the need for valve replacement surgery. Pibarot and his team are also exploring a new minimally invasive procedure that has revolutionized the treatment of AS. It allows a prosthetic valve to be implanted in an artery through a catheter. Pibarot hopes this research will lead to other novel technologies, drugs and strategies to improve the diagnosis, prevention and treatment of AS and other VHDs. "

This disease leads to progressive weakening of the skeletal muscles, paralysis and death. We have known since 1993 that mutations in the superoxide dismutase (SOD1) gene are responsible for 20 per cent of the cases of ALS in families. However, in the majority of cases, the causes of the disease remain unknown. It is thought that multiple genetic factors are probably implicated in these ""sporadic"" cases of ALS. Some recent studies suggest that abnormal accumulations of the proteins that form the cytoskeleton may contribute to the process of neurodegeneration that characterizes this disease. However, the toxic processes associated with mutated SOD1 or with abnormalities of the cytoskeleton are still poorly understood and at present we have no therapeutic approach that can halt the progress of the disease. Holder of a doctorate in biochemistry and possessing special expertise in neurobiology, as Canada Research Chair in Neurodegeneration, Jean-Pierre Julien will devote most his time to studying the mechanisms implicated in the selective loss of motor neurons. To do this, he will use rats with ALS bred in his laboratory. One aspect of his research seeks to better understand the deleterious effects that occur when neurofilaments accumulate on intracellular transports. Prof. Julien will also study the role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of ALS. In addition, he will use rats afflicted with the juvenile form of ALS-recently developed in his laboratory-to determine other factors that are linked to the degeneration and vulnerability of certain types of motor neurons. While we know very well that ALS is a complex disease, Prof. Julien's laboratory recently demonstrated that a combination of three medications, each with a different therapeutic target, was able to significantly impede the progress of ALS in laboratory rats. This discovery will make it possible to soon develop clinical trials of this pharmacological ""cocktail"" for human patients suffering from ALS. Prof. Julien seeks to discover and demonstrate the molecular and cellular mechanisms of ALS that contribute to the loss of motor neurons. His research will have important implications for the discovery of new therapeutic targets and for the development of more effective treatments for neurodegenerative diseases. "

Since the ratification of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 1989, the trade in processed foods has grown spectacularly. Québec, which used to have a negative trade balance, has become a net exporter. The liberalization of trade associated with bilateral agreements like NAFTA and multilateral negotiations like those conducted under the aegis of the World Trade Organization, has called into question Canada's domestic and trade policies as well as the strategies we use to market our agricultural food products.Beginning with various hypotheses about market structures, Bruno Larue will analyze trade policies as they affect agricultural food products. Specifically, he will analyze tariffs, quotas, voluntary restrictions on exports and restricted market access, using theoretical models that take account of institutional peculiarities found in agricultural food products industries.In the space of a decade, Québec's pork industry has increased its marketing campaigns from one to three. During the same period, the institutions that regulate the dairy and grain industries have become the object of trade disputes. For these reasons, Prof. Larue will analyze, in the context of trade liberalization, the development and effectiveness of Canadian domestic policies and marketing strategies.Finally, Prof. Larue will use empirical methods to analyze the impacts that geography, changes in technology and changes in market power have on the volume of trade in agricultural food products.Agreements reached at the World Trade Organization negotiations conducted in Doha, Qatar in 2001, will make it possible to improve market access, subsidies for exports, domestic support, sanitary and phytosanitary standards and the business of publicly-owned firms. Prof. Larue's work will help decision makers and leaders in the agricultural food products sector rise to the challenge of globalization. "

About 17 percent of Canadians are over the age of 60 and an increasing number of Canadians are living well into their 80's and 90's. Since cognitive performance and skills, such as learning and memory, appear to decline with age, research into an interdisciplinary field known as ""cognitive aging"" is growing. Cognitive aging research draws from such neighbouring disciplines as cognitive, developmental, and differential psychology, as well as health and the neurosciences.Dr. Roger Dixon is the Principal Investigator of the Victoria Longitudinal Study (VLS), a project that has laboratories at the University of Alberta and the University of Victoria. The VLS provides a fertile context in which to investigate important facets of cognitive aging. It features sequences of longitudinal designs, thus including complementary data pertaining to age differences, age changes, and individual differences. The VLS reflects the coordinated interest in both traditional and novel aspects of cognitive aging, including actual changes in late life, individual differences, and shifting patterns of pertinent determinants, contexts and outcomes. This long-term and large-scale project is trying to answer important questions regarding basic and applied cognitive aging. Questions such as: What are the normal late-life change patterns associated with a variety of cognitive indicators? To what extent do changing cognitive resources, biological functioning, and health conditions predict normal cognitive changes? And are the profiles and predictors different for selected subpopulations (including cognitively impaired and Alzheimer's patients) now available in the VLS? As Canada Research Chair in Cognition and Aging, Dr. Dixon is helping the VLS to expand and refine its research. He is using his existing and growing longitudinal data set to selectively extend and expand the investigation of actual cognitive changes with aging. "

A significant find might have been within your grasp if you'd only drilled the hole a few meters to the left or to the right. Geostatistics has changed all this. Geostatisticians help fill in the blanks in the data supplied by traditional core and seismic sampling by using computer models to predict what's going on in an un-sampled location and to provide a probability of how much oil, ore or waste lies between sampled locations. Dr. Clayton Deutsch constructs these mathematical models and he is spending his time as the Canada Research Chair in Natural Resources Uncertainty Management using them to estimate the amount of natural resources there are in the earth.Dr. Deutsch knows that decision makers need to have a precise measure of what they can or cannot expect to find. While current techniques are evolving, they are far from exact, which is why he trying to develop general geostatistical tools that can be applied anywhere and that are flexible enough to adapt to many different situations. One of the challenges facing Dr. Deutsch and fellow geostatisticians is how to overcome the variability of geology. For example, the same type of rock can be different in different locations. One can find sandstone in one place, and sandstone in another. But the sandstones aren't identical. Sandstone A might have proven to be a good place to look for oil. But that doesn't necessarily mean that sandstone B indicates a good place as well. With the world becoming increasingly concerned about non-renewable natural resources and environmental impact, Dr. Deutsch's research could well lead to more efficient means of producing natural resources while lessening the impact such production has on the environment-a win for both society and industry.

Physicians can then use these simulations to help their patients.A related focus of Wan's research program is the development of better methods for analyzing medical images to help in diagnoses. The issue of ""matching up"" multiple images to form a coherent diagnostic picture is particularly important in computer-aided surgery, in which precisely localizing different tissues is critical.

How did they overcome language barriers, different medical beliefs, and fear of government authorities? Who had success in keeping the media message positive and clear, and how did they do it?These questions are vital - literally. SARS has shown us that an increasingly multi-cultural Canada needs to develop better health communication strategies for epidemics that are already visible on the horizon. The answers that Palmer and his research team find in our past will shape the nature of public debate about health communication for our future. "

One of the leaders in this area is Canada Research Chair Dr. Ren-Ke Li of the University of Toronto and the University Health Network.For the past 15 years, Li has experimented with restoring damaged hearts by replacing cells killed by heart disease with healthy ones. He was the first scientist to demonstrate that cell transplantation improves heart function after heart attack. Now Li is looking for the best cells to use for transplantation; some cells are more suitable than others for patients with different health conditions. People with muscle problems, for example, may well not have healthy muscle cells that can be transplanted in the heart. Li suspects that a person's bone marrow may be a good source of stem cells for cardiac regeneration. In addition to his search for optimal cell types, Li is also trying to identify signalling factors. Signalling factors direct stem cells to travel to the damaged heart for new tissue regeneration.Li's research into the mechanisms responsible for improved cardiac function and treatment strategies to augment the beneficial effects of cell transplantation is adding to the many positive trends now in place for the management of people with heart disease, helping them live longer, healthier lives.

Canada Research Chair David Juncker heads a laboratory at McGill where researchers bioengineer micro- and nanosystems for miniaturizing biochemical processes. These systems are still much simpler than a living cell, but they have similar dimensions of a few thousands of a millimetre or even less, and therefore have to be fabricated with processes similar to the ones used for making silicon microprocessors. Juncker is particularly interested in microfluidic systems, which can, for example, be used to analyze the biochemical profile of a cell. Such an analysis could help us understand how cancer arises, how it progresses, and ultimately lead to better treatments by producing disease profiles. Juncker is also looking into the use of micro- and nanosystems to probe the function and response of single cells. The tools he develops could be used to stimulate a neural or a cardiac cell, helping us to understand how the cell functions and why it responds the way it does to being disturbed.

A major focus of his research is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from manured soils, which are an important source of nitrous oxide and often methane. Tenuta uses advanced micrometeorological techniques to monitor methane levels at test sites in Manitoba, and he is experimenting with different types of manure and manure storage systems.In addition, Tenuta uses biological indicators to evaluate conventional and organic management approaches, studying factors like crop rotation, no-tillage practices, and manure use at long-term sites in Manitoba and Canada. Tenuta is concerned with the development of reliable bio-indicators. Bioindicators are typically species or assemblages that can indicate whether there's been a disruption in ecosystem processes. For example, indicators of poor soil health include reduced species diversity and changes in the make-up of organism communities. In his current research, Tenuta is examining the use of nematodes as bio-indicators, along with bacterial and fungal levels in soil. His exciting work with bio-indicators is contributing to a promising shift in how we produce our food.

What is the cost effectiveness of a new treatment for opiate addiction? How should limited health-care budgets be allocated to competing programs? These are the kind of critical questions being asked of our health-care system, and ones that Canada Research Chair Dr. Greg Zaric is answering with models of his own creation.In the case of the first question posed above, there are currently more than 20,000 people waiting for joint replacement surgery in Ontario and wait times can exceed one year. As Canadians age, the demand for this type of surgery is expected to grow considerably. How much capacity is needed to keep up with demand and to reduce waiting time? What is the impact of directing patients out-of-province for their surgery? Zaric's computer simulation models are enabling him to test several different policy options to help solve such problems of our overburdened system.Zaric is also looking into the cost-effectiveness of drug treatment programs. For instance, methadone maintenance treatment for opiate addiction is known to be cost effective, in large part because it reduces HIV risk among injection drug users. But there are numerous other drug treatment programs and strategies in existence. Are they just as cost effective? Zaric's mathematical models explore the relationship between injection drug use and the HIV epidemic in an effort to determine which programs and strategies are most cost effective.The above represent just two examples of the types of health-care dilemmas to which Zaric is responding with his mathematical and economical modelling. His research is clearly relevant to those making health policy decisions in Canada as its insights will help to inform them about how best to allocate resources within a struggling health-care system.

Just how does social experience and behaviour influence an individual's physiology-from neural anatomy to gene expression? Sigal Balshine, Canada Research Chair in Aquatic Behavioural Ecology, uses a social species of fish-Neolamprologus pulcher from Lake Tanganyika-to find the answer. She studies the species to learn how complex social behaviours (social aggression, subordination and cooperation) influence the brain and general physiology, and to compare the effects between males and females.The fish exist in two states: as subordinate helpers and as dominant breeders. Subordinate helpers assist breeding pairs in caring for young, as well as in defence and maintenance of their territory.To help answer the ""big"" question, Balshine focuses on specific questions related to the fish such as: How do social rank and sex influence the degree of cooperative versus conflict behaviour? How does variation in social experience (degree of conflict and cooperation) affect levels of sex hormones, cortisol, body condition, and reproductive investment? Is there a difference, in categories such as gross brain morphology, neuropeptide concentrations or gene expression, between males and females? Between dominant and subordinate fish? And how does social experience influence brain anatomy?Building on previous research, Balshine is testing new ideas concerning the influence of social experience from the molecular/cellular level to physiology, anatomy and behaviour. Her research is pioneering work, as she is the first to examine the influence of cooperation and conflict on the brain, behaviour and physiology in both males and females. And, since she is focusing on a small social fish, she is able to unravel some of the mechanisms responsible for cooperative breeding-something not practical for researchers working with most other social vertebrates.

These information subgroups can then be segregated, studied and treated differently-a process that leads to better policies and decisions. For example, insurance companies organize individuals into homogeneous risk groups-according to such risk factors as age, gender, or history of illness-and then charge premiums that reflect the different rates of risk. To take another example: in a health study involving volumes of data, even patients diagnosed with the same disease are not completely alike. Doctors and health analysts use genetic information to identify subgroups of patients who may benefit from a special treatment. Identifying subgroups is Jiahua Chen's business. As Canada Research Chair in Statistical Inference, Chen develops statistical methods to estimate the number of subgroups within a mass of data. He uses these methods to deal with data that has many, many variables, such as those obtained in microarray experiments of gene expression, where thousands of genes are identified. In addition to sheer numbers of genes, statisticians like Chen must also consider that the identifying characteristics, or variables, have different relationships in different subgroups. From this complex set of data, he must determine which variables can be used to predict the data that can be categorized as belonging to a distinct subgroup. Chen's complex area of research calls for new statistical theory as well as implementing user-friendly software, but in the end both his theory and methods can be applied to many disciplines ranging from astronomy, biology and engineering to marketing-and, of course, genetics.

By reducing the composition of a material's internal structure to the nano-scale-one billionth of a metre-he is creating substances with higher mechanical strength, enhanced reactivity and higher electrical resistivity than is possible with conventional methods.But before these materials can realize their full commercial potential, Brochu must work out problems related to their fabrication and welding. His research is delving into the practical questions raised by working with materials that are extremely small. And already he is finding answers. Conventional welding at high temperatures often causes changes to the materials' properties and structures. Brochu has found a way to weld nano-materials into assemblies that avoids this typical degradation.He is also working on a method that uses controlled shockwaves to pack nano-structured powders closely together into bulk materials. This process imposes pressure levels that are unattainable by traditional equipment. By developing new structures and better materials-for example, aluminum that is stronger than steel-Brochu's research will help create stronger, safer and more effective materials for high-end structures, such as jet engines and space shuttles.

Using a technique called X-ray crystallography, Nagar is studying the protein receptors responsible for triggering these dangerous immune system responses. While we know these proteins-called Toll-like receptors (TLRs)-act as first warning systems against infection in healthy people, the mechanisms they use to recognize invaders and signal a response remain largely a mystery. By crystallizing the molecules that make up the protein and then using X-rays to ""see"" the crystals, Nagar is able to reconstruct 3-D images of the TLRs and analyze their structures. This research will allow Nagar to uncover not only how TLRs function normally, but also how they can be modulated for the development of drugs to treat and prevent the debilitating inflammation associated with certain infectious diseases and autoimmune disorders.

He believes that understanding microfibrils and how they function is the first step towards understanding, diagnosing and treating connective tissue disorders. Reinhardt is working to identify all the components of the microfibrils and to figure out the different ways they function in various tissues as well as attempting to understand how microfibrils transmit instructive signals to cells, especially during cell development. More than just understanding the microfibrils role in connective tissue disorders, Reinhardt is also identifying the gene products that create disease-causing pathways to develop in a person's cells.

These chemicals have shown promise for the safe and efficient removal of environmentally-hazardous substances from industrial processes, such as the burning of coal.These specialized compounds can trap CO2 from waste streams using much less energy than the traditional technologies now employed. The CO2 can then be separated from the ionic liquid system and stored, allowing the ionic liquid to be recycled to remove additional CO2.Clyburne’s liquids may one day provide an alternative to the scrubbers now in place on most coal-fired power plants. Affordable removal of carbon dioxide from gaseous industrial emissions is considered one of the holy grails in climate change research.

They use these proteins to adjust the chemical composition and volume of their internal and external fluid environments. ""Internal environment"" generally refers to the cytoplasm of cells, while ""external environment"" refers to various spaces such the channels carrying blood, urine, lymph, etc. It is therefore easy to understand why some diseases can be caused or made worse by a dysfunction in ion transporters and that specific substances acting on these proteins have medicinal properties and value. There are large numbers of ion transporters, and they exist in many different forms. The ones of interest to Dr. Isenring and his team belong to a class of proteins called cation-chloride co-transporters. They make it possible for various cations (like sodium and potassium) to move with anion chloride from one body fluid to another. A number of studies have shown that cation-chloride co-transporters play a very important role in controlling blood volume and, therefore, blood pressure. For example, there are some drugs that counteract the progression of cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension, heart failure and fluid retention by preventing various cation-chloride co-transporters from operating. The main goal of the research projects being conducted by Dr. Isenring's team is to analyse the operating mechanisms of cation-chloride co-transporters and understand their role in normal physiological processes and in the development of cardiovascular and kidney diseases. Another goal is to discover or produce substances that will trigger changes in the activity of various cation-chloride co-transporters as effectively and precisely as possible. In this context, Dr. Isenring and his team have already identified some very promising compounds. In short, the planned research could lead to the identification of new therapies to slow the progression of specific cardiovascular diseases. In so doing, it could not only help to change medical practices in a number of specialties but also open up innovative research avenues in biomedical science. "

Scientists have described more than 200,000 species of marine species, and there are no doubt many more to be discovered; yet, to date, only a limited number of these species have been explored as possible sources of therapeutic agents. Excitement in the prospects of marine pharmacology is tempered by a growing problem that is not unfamiliar to the pharmaceutical industry: limited supply. The only sources of many compounds used to develop therapeutic drugs are organisms (such as coral or sponge) that have to be collected from fragile marine environments. Extracting the necessary compounds without damaging the environment is a major obstacle and one that Canada Research Chair Russell Kerr is working to overcome. In his current research, Kerr is exploring different species of marine life as possible sources of new therapeutic agents and looking for benign extraction methods.

These new conditions are definitely having an effect on social and occupational integration, the ability to work, and job retention. They also raise important questions about worker adaptation and the mechanisms underlying individuals' investment in, and relationship to, work. Louise St-Arnaud's goal is to advance theoretical and practical knowledge of occupational integration and the psychosocial environment of work, using an interdisciplinary approach. Dr. St-Arnaud's Canada Research Chair program reflects her original approach to research, involving the design and implementation of projects in close cooperation with practitioners (businesses, professionals, workers, etc.). Her approach will generate more effective solutions to the problems experienced by young workers without any qualifications and older workers without the skills needed for a rapidly changing workplace and new requirements. The pressures exerted by work transformations also affect workers' psychological health. Many Canadian companies report a staggering increase in the number of days of sick leave due to psychological health problems. Yet in spite of the extent of the problem, very few studies have focused on the processes of occupational withdrawal and reintegration of the workers concerned. Dr. St-Arnaud's research will generate a greater understanding of the influence of the psychosocial environment of work on occupational withdrawal and the role of community stakeholders in the process of occupational reintegration and job retention. In a rapidly changing organizational context, where types of employment status are increasing in number and their structures are breaking down in business and industry, where companies are turning to contracting-out, and where the employer-employee relationship is no longer a stable one, labour collectives and occupational identities are breaking down as well. The research will yield a deeper understanding of the mechanisms that forge and break the bonds involved in workers' investment in, and relationship to, work itself. The research is based on workers' collective contribution to the process of analysing and understanding their work situation. Dr. St-Arnaud will examine social relations in the workplace, exploiting concepts such as social support, labour collectives and recognition. The research will have a significant impact on job retention and the quality of life of workers and on the harmonious development of organizations. "

However, DNA can be reconstituted through natural protein-related mechanisms, and it is the various means of reconstitution that Professor Verreault plans to shed light on in order to develop the role of revitalizing processes in the treatment of specific diseases.His work may lead to significant improvements in cancer treatments. Although the purpose of such treatments is to destroy cancer cells, they destroy many healthy cells at the same time and affect the information coded in DNA. With a greater understanding of the natural mechanisms for reconstituting DNA, it should be possible to improve chemotherapy treatments and enhance patients' recovery. "

The destruction of bone that occurs in this group of disorders (which include osteoporosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and periodontitis), is carried out by osteoclasts. In health, these cells help maintain strong bones. But in disease, the cells not only destroy bone, but also play a primary role in establishing primary and metastatic bone tumours. Canada Research Chair Svetlana Komarova works at decoding the events that follow the stimulation of osteoclast to begin destroying bone. Osteoclasts are particularly challenging to work with because these very active cells are present in bone only in small numbers. To carry out her research, Komarova employs innovative sophisticated technologies - such as high-speed imaging of live cells, confocal microscopy, and quantitative gene expression analysis - that provide information even when only a few cells are available for study.Komarova also uses mathematical modelling to better understand the consequences of interactions among various molecules that regulate osteoclasts. In this way she is able to integrate and analyze the experimental data more efficiently. Moreover, the predictions produced by the modeling help her to develop new testable hypotheses and experimental designs. Komarova's research into how osteoclasts work may lead to the development of new types of therapy for a variety of debilitating bone diseases. "

As one of the major greenhouse gases, it has a fundamental role in the global biogeochemical cycle of carbon. Through a chemical reaction known as anaerobic oxidation, methane is transformed into carbon dioxide and hydrogen (in the absence of oxygen) by microorganisms living in marine sediment. AOM, as anaerobic methane oxidation is called, plays a significant part in the metabolism of these microorganisms. It also reduces methane flux - that is, the flow of methane gas from ocean to atmosphere. AOM is the subject of geneticist Steven Hallam's research. He is particularly interested in its role in the metabolic processes of the sea sediment-dwelling microorganisms. As the Canada Research Chair in Environmental Genomics at the University of British Columbia, Hallam is developing collections, or genomic libraries, of methane-oxidizing microorganisms from around the world. This extraordinary accomplishment will enable scientists to learn much more about the molecular mechanisms of AOM by screening the libraries for enzymes that trigger AMO.Hallam's interest in these microorganisms also extends to the way they help to mediate both local and global biogeochemical cycles as well as their potential as catalysts for biotechnological development. In addition, he is working to improve special ""genome-enabled"" methods for monitoring their community dynamics, especially in relation to AOM.Hallam's research will have far-reaching effects on areas as diverse as climate change, alternative energy development, and - through the discovery of new biocatalysts - on biotechnology.

These diseases are characterized by an exaggerated immune response. In the case of allergies, the response is to harmless environmental substances-such as grass pollen and house-dust mites. In the case of certain autoimmune diseases, such as Type II diabetes, the reaction is to proteins in the patient's own body. In both cases, the costs are enormous.While the exact reasons behind the epidemic remain only partially defined, it is clear that we need to find ways to combat it. And that's where the work of Canada Research Chair in Allergy and Immune Tolerance Mark Larché comes in. Larché uses synthetic fragments (peptides) of the proteins that cause the disease (pollen, dust mites) to ""switch on"" the immune responses. Because the peptides lack the structure of the whole proteins, they don't stimulate an allergic reaction themselves-but they do trigger the immune system to begin to defend the body. This helps to minimize that body's subsequent allergic reactions.In his current research, Larché has singled out asthma as the perfect model to study these mechanisms, because asthmatics respond swiftly to their triggers, and the responses can be measured easily. His research into asthma includes a study of the pathway that links the ""switching on"" of the immune response with the symptoms of asthma (such as constriction of the airways), as well as the process of identifying the biomarkers that will help the diagnosis and treatment of asthma, and the screening of anti-asthma drugs. In the long run, Larché hopes his research will lead to the production of peptide vaccines for the treatment of a wide range of chronic immune diseases. "

This is the primary question that Dr. Lori G. Beaman, Canada Research Chair in Religious Diversity and Social Change, is exploring. Societies are grappling with a combination of increased religious diversity, a renewed presence of religion in the public sphere, and growing numbers of people who describe themselves as having no religion. Beaman’s research examines how the increase in those identifying as nonreligious is changing the religious landscape. The potential impact of this shift is profound, yet the contours of it have yet to be fully explored. Beaman’s work examines issues that are deeply important to policy makers—in fields from education to health to law—who are seeking ways of responding to this new “normal” and the conflict it engenders. Given Canada’s history of global leadership on human rights, multiculturalism and diversity, it is well positioned to develop strategies to support a complex future that includes both diverse religious and nonreligious populations. Understanding the range of interactions between these groups by mapping sites of conflict and negotiation is one task of this programme of research. Another is to discover how differences are negotiated or conflict is intensified. Ultimately, this research will identify non-conflictual approaches to diversities across the religion/nonreligion spectrum. "

To make matters worse, the production of cement has been found to have negative environmental effects: The production of one ton of cement releases nearly a ton of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. Since repair materials use large amounts of cement, there is an urgent need to develop repair materials that consume less cement and employ large amounts of industrial by-products and wastes. As Canada Research Chair in Infrastructure Rehabilitation and Sustainability, Nemkumar Banthia is developing innovative and cost effective rehabilitation techniques for our national infrastructure. From crack-free, environmentally friendly, and durable cement-based repair materials to a simple and cost-effective structural strengthening technique that uses sprayed fibre-reinforced polymers, Banthia's materials and processes are being applied to a variety of field demonstrations including bridges, parking garages, buildings, and marine structures.

The government can help this process by developing effective education and labour market policies.Dr. Lance Lochner, Canada Research Chair in Human Capital and Productivity, is providing the Canadian government with sound research to base its policies on such issues as skill formation, income inequality and intergenerational mobility (changes in social status from parents’ to children’s generations). Little is known about why some families make substantial investments in their children, while others do not. Lochner believes the answer is crucial to designing policies that improve the skills of youth.To better understand postsecondary enrolment and completion patterns, Lochner is also developing and testing economic theories regarding borrowing opportunities and repayment and default incentives for Canadian students. In addition, Lochner is exploring the extent to which people acquire skills after school by making costly investments in job training skills, learning-by-doing and job search activity. Understanding why some people experience little wage improvement while others see huge wage increases over their careers is central to the government's design of income and employment assistance programs.

These latter compounds include natural products that have long been valued for their use in dyes, perfumes, oils, and drugs. Unfortunately, the isolation of such compounds from plants can be a very costly process - limited by low yield, impurity, inadequate plant sources, and damage to the environment - and so their supply is often limited. This problem can be overcome by biosynthesizing the drugs in their laboratories and scientists are working on ways to custom-make these products in bulk by engineering microbes and plants.Canada Research Chair Dae-Kyun Ro is one such scientist. He relies on his hybrid education in plant biochemistry and microbial metabolic engineering to lay the groundwork for improving the production and quality of plant bioproducts by clarifying the basic principles that govern their synthesis and regulation. In particular, Ro works with enzymes involved in the manufacture of one group of phytochemical compounds known as terpenoids. Phytochemicals are chemicals found in plants (notably fruit and vegetables) that contain protective, disease-preventing compounds. As Ro creates strains of microbes that produce phytochemicals, he is acquiring the experience he will need to carry out future investigations into plants that can produce hydrocarbons for use as renewable energy sources.

Canada Research Chair Yurij Mozhariviskyj is part of that effort. A research chemist at McMaster University, Mozharivskyj works on new advanced materials with special properties that are an improvement over existing materials in their environmental friendliness and energy efficiency. One group of materials under scrutiny in his lab are magnetocaloric; they heat up and cool down in response to changes in magnetic field. A fridge made of a magnetocaloric material would not only be environmentally friendly and quiet, but also more energy efficient compared to traditional ones. Other materials being studied in Mozharivskyj's lab include ferromagnetic shape memory alloys and thermoelectric materials. In ferromagnetic shape memory alloys, application of a magnetic field on a sample leads to a giant magnetostriction. When the magnetic field is ""unloaded,"" the original shape and dimensions of the sample are recovered. Because materials made with these alloys respond quickly and possess properties that make them efficient, they can be used as actuators, switches, sensors, and positioning devices. In thermoelectric materials, which involve the conversion of heat into electricity, Mozhariviskyj is looking for new ways to produce the desired effect that result in a reduction in the traditional levels of thermal conductivity.

And in order to clarify how nature affects repairs, she studies how enzymes in our body repair our DNA by chemically removing the damaged sections of DNA. Computers help Wetmore examine molecules that are difficult or impossible to learn about using traditional experiments. For example, it is difficult to study some molecules experimentally because they live for such a short time; using computers, however, speeds up the process so she can investigate their properties thoroughly. Computer simulations are the tool of choice that not only allow Wetmore to study molecules quickly and cheaply but also allow her to study chemically modified DNA pieces that have applications as drugs or tools for biotechnology. Several drugs in use today, for instance, are based on the structure of DNA. One of Wetmore's tactics is to make certain molecules bind to the region in DNA that is responsible for a genetic disorder. This binding blocks the expression of that area of the DNA, and thus - if applied therapeutically - could prevent the disorder from appearing. "

As a result, healthcare professionals are now required to play a new role as ""decision brokers,"" and patients are being asked to participate actively in decision making on their health. In this context, decision-making processes are being transformed. Shared decision making is a process requiring the participation of both patient and physician. It must be based on proven scientific data and highlight the risks and benefits of all available options, including that of taking no action at all. Naturally, shared decision making must take the patient's values and preferences into account. Although clinical decision making can be backed up by the best scientific evidence, other factors must be considered, especially in cases of uncertainty. The shared decision-making model meets public expectations and is well suited to situations where the options and outcomes are unclear. It is an approach with a positive impact on individuals. This process is not yet in very widespread use. As chairholder, France Légaré plans to gain a better understanding of the needs of professionals delivering primary health care and prompt them to promote shared decision making, develop the tools needed to apply this new professional technique, build the most effective strategies for introducing the tools, and assess their impact. Professor Légaré will also work on designing effective intervention systems for implementing a shared decision-making process in primary health care, and particularly in cases involving the use of natural products during menopause, treatment with antibiotics for respiratory infections and prenatal genetic screening. Professor Légaré's program will generate significant benefits for the medical community and patients alike. It will help to support patients in the process of making decisions on their health, to harmonize their expectations with the practices of the Canadian healthcare system and its professionals and, last but not least, to improve patients' health.

These decisions, and the thought processes that lead up to them, are based on countless social and cultural factors about which we understand very little. Michael Lambek, however, wants to understand more. He is exploring the forces that shape human action - and he believes they start with ethics. As Canada Research Chair in the Anthropology of Ethical Life, Lambek concentrates on the ethical qualities, consequences, and limits of human action, and examines the culturally diverse vehicles through which human action takes place.Lambek's work takes him from the Indian Ocean to France and Switzerland, where two distinctly different research programs converge to answer similar questions.In one study, Lambek is observing Malagasy speakers - both in their native Mayotte (an island in the western Indian Ocean) and in France, which owns the tiny island. He is documenting and analyzing the changing lives, religious, and social practices of Mayotte's Malagasy-speaking people, as the island society has shifted from being a remote colony to an integral part of the French state.In his other research program, Lambek switches his attention to Switzerland to a study of well-being and moral concerns in a society that is characterized, in general, by economic prosperity and intensive political participation. Here, the lens of his analysis is on the lively challenges to conventional medicine and religion put forward by the practitioners and proponent of various complementary forms of healing, some of which have a long history in the region, and which, at least implicitly, offer alternative models for human existence, self-cultivation, and virtuous living that have been at the heart of what has been meant by ethics since the ancient Greeks. These two seemingly divergent research programs have a common goal: to develop a more balanced and complex picture of ethical social action, complete with the cultural and social contexts that both enable - and limit it.Lambek's work is unique in its perspective, and it promises to advance anthropological theory by demonstrating the centrality of moral practice and judgement to social life and cultural transformation.

Mud and dirt.Kohfeld uses ocean mud and continental dirt to track changes in global dust and ocean carbon levels over tens and even hundreds of thousands of years. Knowing how the dust distribution varied in the past allows her to test predictions of future global climate change. In her research, Kohfeld designs large computer databases that track global dust emissions and analyzes ocean sediments to detect changes in ocean productivity through time. How are these related? The iron in dust provides an important microfertilizer to ocean plankton. This, in turn, affects the productivity of the plankton and therefore their ability to absorb atmospheric carbon dioxide. Using the record of geological dust levels and ocean productivity that can be found in ocean sediments, together with her vast databases, Kohfeld works to improve the models presently in use to predict potential global climate scenarios.The debate about global warming will continue, but we can look to Kohfeld for solid data-based in dust, strangely enough-to help us predict future trends in global climate change.

Infectious disease is the leading cause of mortality worldwide, accounting for one in four deaths. This, combined with the threat of high-profile pandemics such as avian flu, is concentrating public attention on the importance given to infectious diseases. Historically, few medical interventions have been as clearly successful as vaccination, which eliminated smallpox and has greatly reduced polio and other infectious diseases. For years, policy-makers had little difficulty implementing decisions about vaccines because the diseases they prevented were especially severe and the costs of the vaccines were relatively inexpensive. Now, however, deciding whether to vaccinate is much more problematic: Vaccines cost a lot more and health budgets are stretched to the limit. Canada Research Chair Marc Brisson's previous research into the important questions surrounding vaccination, produced results that influenced recommendations regarding varicella vaccination (against chickenpox and shingles) in Canada and abroad. His current research focuses on modelling the health and economic impact of the vaccines against human papillomavirus (which causes cervical cancer) and shingles. He is also examining the efficiency of existing vaccine programs. In his research, Brisson asks questions like: How should limited health-care budgets be allocated to competing programs? Who should be vaccinated and at what age? What's the cost-effectiveness of different strategies? What's the risk of negative population effects by introducing a new vaccine? To answer these questions, Brisson develops and uses complex models aimed at helping policy-makers make the best decisions possible for the good of our society. "

In addition, Marquis is clarifying the benefits breastfeeding has for children and how different physiological states, such as a new pregnancy or maternal illness, can affect those benefits. In her work related to preschoolers, Marquis is working on ways to improve the diets of children in Ghana. As in other low-income countries, preschool children suffer from an insufficiency of micronutrients, especially iron. So Marquis and her colleagues have a project that is aimed at ensuring that children get foods that are rich in micronutrients. They're starting up a similar project in Uganda as well.Marquis' research on child feeding will produce valuable recommendations on ways to ensure the health and well-being of children around the world.Marquis will also contribute to the International Research Chairs Initiative (IRCI), a new partnership between the International Development Research Centre and the Canada Research Chairs Program.

This is the case of our right and left hands, and is also the case of most molecules encountered in living organisms. One of the mysteries of life is that natural molecules are found only with one single handedness - left or right, but never both.Despite their huge similarity, left- and right-handed molecules can have radically different properties when involved in a biochemical reaction. Drugs, too: thalidomide, for instance, can be useful in some medical treatments, but is poison when its handedness is reversed. This kind of thing is what makes handedness such an intriguing feature. Physicists have studied chiral molecules for a long time, and among the physical techniques, optical properties have always been of paramount importance. These properties, cast under the generic name of ""natural optical activity"" have been known for more than a century. Jean-Michel Nunzi studies the photonic and electronic properties of materials. A pioneer of using light to create order and structure in organic materials, Nunzi, with the help of coworkers, designs and builds devices that exploit the optical, magnetic, and electronic properties of chiral materials in the design of sensors for bio-technologies and diagnostics in medicine.In his current research as the Canada Research Chair in Photonics for Life, Nunzi is working on optical diagnostic tools to recognize and identify chiral substances at a microscopic scale. These tools will be used to study how chirality appears, starting from non-chiral substances, and how it extends to bulk materials. His ultimate goal is to find a way to exploit chirality at the scale of nanometres (billionth of metre) to build complex structures and devices for electronics and photonics. "

Think: Silicon Valley.Building on past work on industrial clusters and regional economic specialization, Bathelt, the Canada Research Chair in Innovation and Governance, investigates the interconnections that link economic development, innovation, and policy.Bathelt believes that the economic success of a city is connected to the social interactions that occur in tandem with economic processes. This means that regional prosperity depends on more than just traditional economic policy. As he explores this notion, Bathelt uses an interdisciplinary mix of methods ranging from statistical analysis to in-depth interviews, while also mobilizing a network of international collaborators to help him in his research. Bathelt's program includes a study of the development of industrial clusters for traditional sectors as well as newer sectors like film and advertising, and an examination of the role of international trade fairs as temporary industrial clusters. In addition, Bathelt is interested in the flow of knowledge between biotechnology clusters and venture capital firms, the industrial restructuring and regional change that have occurred in the chemical industry, and the evolution of German-style capitalism. And - as if that's not ambitious enough - he is also exploring the establishment of production and research networks in China by foreign firms. All in search of a better understanding of the dynamics of local and regional clusters and their connections to global processes.

While medication can now control the vomiting in about 60 to 70 per cent of people, stemming the nausea has proven to be much more difficult. Canada Research Chair Linda Parker, a behavioural neuroscientist, pursues a program of research that cuts across the traditional boundaries of psychology, pharmacology, and neurobiology to deliver new findings that may well change the way cancer is treated. One of Parker's innovations is the use of shrews and rats to gauge the effectiveness of anti-vomiting and anti-nausea agents; previously, scientists had no good non-human experimental subjects.Using these animals, Parker has been able to test THC and cannabidiol, two compounds found in marijuana. Both suppress nausea and vomiting in the animals, but cannabidiol, unlike THC, is non-intoxicating. Establishing cannabidiol's anti-nausea and anti-vomiting properties is thus a discovery that could have enormous clinical value.Parker is also pursuing research on chemicals found naturally in the human body that mimic those in marijuana. These ""endogenous cannabinoids,"" discovered in the 1990s, play a role not only in controlling nausea and vomiting, but also in such things as learning, memory, protection against stroke and cancer, appetite, reward and addiction.

Dr. Mohan Matthen, Canada Research Chair in Philosophy, Perception, and Communication, has been pondering this and related questions as he builds a theory of how human senses work. In his 2005 book Seeing, Doing and Knowing, Matthen tried to build a philosophical model of perception. He is now working on putting his theories into a more general context. Traditionally, the senses are taken to be pipelines that passively receive information, which the agent then uses to make knowledge. Matthen argues that the senses are active, engaging with the real world by bodily exploration and active data-analysis. Moreover, he does not see the senses as entirely separate, but as organs of a unified knowledge-gathering facility.A wide-ranging philosopher, Matthen has also worked with interpretations of evolutionary theory. Instead of a causal process, he says it is actually a mathematical aggregation of independent events. For Matthen, natural selection is a series of unconnected births, mating and deaths, where a statistical pattern emerges but still cannot be defined as a process, as is generally assumed. By delving further into these two areas, Matthen’s research will lead to a better understanding of how we use our senses to create knowledge, as well as a better understanding of evolution. "

The deadly Clostridium difficile diarrhea epidemic that struck patients in Canadian hospitals in 2004 provides a vivid example of this threat. More recently, the emergence in India of the NDM-1 gene that confers resistance to a large spectrum of antibiotics and its rapid spread in most developed countries since 2010 shows the disturbing ease with which these bacteria can adapt to the often excessive use of antibiotics.Dr. Vincent Burrus, Canada Research Chair in Bacterial Molecular Genetics, is focusing his research on integrative conjugative elements (ICEs)—large segments of DNA carried by bacterial chromosomes that can be spread by casual contact between donor and recipient cells. The mobility of ICE facilitates the spread of antibiotic-resistant genes. ICEs may also help to convert bacteria into deadly strains that are difficult, if not impossible, to combat.Burrus is focusing on the ICEs of the SXT/R391 family, which for the last 20 years have been invading populations of Vibrio cholerae, the infectious agent that causes cholera. Burrus is also examining how two different ICEs in the same cell can recombine, or exchange their genetic material, to compose new ICE hybrids with different patterns of antibiotic resistance. By identifying the environmental signals that trigger the formation of new ICEs, his research will lead to new practices and treatments that will limit the spread of resistance genes and maintain the effectiveness of existing antibiotics.

Faced with an ever-increasing demand for raw materials to fuel the rapid growth of the world economy, while at the same time meeting ever more stringent environmental constraints, the mining industry must keep up by developing new technology. This is particularly true in the area of mineral processing in Canada's oil industry. Canada's oil sands are a mixture of sand, water and bitumen, a heavy viscous crude oil that can be processed into high-quality synthetic oil. The trick is to find the best possibly way to separate the bitumen from the sand that respects the environment as well as cost requirements. This is a challenging process that calls for a multidisciplinary approach like the one being carried out by Zhenghe Xu, the Canada Research Chair in Mineral Processing at the University of Alberta.In mineral processing, mined ores are first crushed and ground to break minerals and metals off waste rocks (liberation). The liberated minerals and metals are then separated by physical methods such as gravity separation, magnetic separation, electrostatic separation and flotation. Xu studies the potential of flotation for primary separation in the process of extracting bitumen from oil sands. In this process, various colloidal interactions determine the success and efficiency of separation. Since numerous complex problems have been encountered using existing oil-sands extraction processes, Xu is determined to clarify the colloidal interactions involved in flotation and develop a more versatile, effective separation process. He believes that flotation promises a more environmentally responsible form of bitumen extraction from Alberta's oil sands that will maintain the growth of the industry and secure Canada's energy source for the next 200 years.

The interruptions caused by the phosphatases are not all bad. For example, if the signal will cause problems down the line, the actions of the phosphatases can be good news. But how does all this apply to Gingras' research? Well, Gingras is exploring the body's resistance to anti-cancer drugs. Cells that are chronically exposed to these drugs often become resistant, so Gingras hopes to develop a protein inhibitor that intercepts the signals that tell those cells to resist. Hence, her interest in the phosphatases.Gingras carries out her work using the University of Toronto's state-of-the-art mass spectrometer, a device that measures the mass of proteins and helps researchers identify and classify them.In addition to conducting her own research into phosphatases, Gingras is developing specialized mass spectrometry tools to help study signalling molecules. She hopes her tools will help other researchers as well in their efforts to analyze protein interaction and communication. "

","This research will encourage the development of therapies that improve cardiovascular health for women and children, and, ultimately, improve the health of all Canadians.",Improving Cardiovascular Health Through Better Pregnancy Outcomes ," Improving Cardiovascular Health Through Better Pregnancy Outcomes Cardiovascular diseases like stroke or heart failure account for 60 per cent of deaths worldwide. Finding ways to diagnose cardiovascular problems earlier could significantly reduce the odds of developing issues later in life. In fact, researchers now think it may be possible to reduce a person’s risk of cardiovascular disease during infancy—or even before birth. As many as 20 per cent of pregnancies are affected by complications—such as pre-eclampsia or poor fetal growth—that can lead to long-term cardiovascular problems for both mothers and their babies. As Canada Research Chair in Maternal and Perinatal Cardiovascular Health, Dr. Sandra Davidge and her research team are looking at how improving outcomes for complicated pregnancies might reduce, or even prevent, future chronic cardiovascular problems in both mothers and their children. Davidge’s research team is looking at how complications during pregnancy can affect the cardiovascular system of both the mother and her child. For example, they examine how substances released by the placenta during complicated pregnancies can cause the mother’s blood vessels to no longer work properly, leading to increased blood pressure and altering the cardiovascular development of her offspring. Davidge believes that increasing understanding about certain pregnancy complications, and finding ways to prevent them, could improve cardiovascular health for mothers and their children, reducing the burden of chronic diseases in the future.

Research has shown that physicians with healthy personal habits are more likely to encourage patients to adopt such habits. The link between the personal and professional health habits of health providers is an abiding concern of Dr. Erica Frank. As the Canada Research Chair in Preventive Medicine and Population Health, she believes that improving the health of physicians may in turn contribute to improved health of patients.Working in concert with the Canadian Medical Association, Dr. Frank is conducting a nationwide survey of Canadian medical residents and practicing physicians, collecting personal and clinical information that will form the basis for development of interventions to improve the personal and clinical health practices of health professionals in training and practice. The data will be compared with a similar study of Canadian nurses. By helping to create a healthy work force of physicians, nurses, and other health-care providers, Dr. Frank is helping to improve the health of the rest of the population. As part of this same effort, she is also collaborating with government officials and researchers in Cambodia, Laos, Colombia, and the United States to promote the health of physicians and physicians in training.In addition as Canada Research Chair, Dr. Frank is continuing her work in developing Health Sciences Online, which provides free, global, online access to a centralized collection of comprehensive, high quality health sciences courses, texts, reference materials, and other e-learning opportunities. This centre, which comprises a full medical, public health, and nursing curriculum, is free and intended to create global health knowledge that can be shared by all. "

Wastewater facilities are designed to remove these contaminants, but unfortunately current treatment processes aren't up to the task. In fact, in the course of treatment, some substances are absorbed and concentrated in solids and then accumulate in even higher concentrations. Besides cleaning up after ourselves is not only about removing waste from the water, it's also about dealing with the waste once the water has been safely disinfected. Certain pathogens and chemicals remain and there are major risks associated with their discharge to the environment. Banu Örmeci knows a lot about wastewater. She focuses on water treatment sludge, the semisolid material precipitated by treatment, and she has already developed early stage technology to reduce the volume of sludge leftover from wastewater treatment using innovative ""dewatering"" techniques. By removing the water from the sludge, the volume of the sludge being generated is reduced.As the Canada Research Chair in Wastewater and Public Health Engineering, Örmeci studies the fundamental processes involved in wastewater treatment to see what happens to the pathogens and chemicals during and beyond the treatment processes. She is especially interested in those that persist and in the management of the leftover residuals. Her project also includes evaluating the impact of wastewater particles and characteristics on the ultraviolet and chlorine disinfection of wastewater. UV disinfection eliminates the production of byproducts caused by chlorine, the cheapest, most widely used method of disinfection in North America. UV light safely destroys microorganisms with the added advantage that you are not adding any more chemicals to the water.Through her research, Örmeci hopes to improve the performance of treatment processes for both liquids and solids, and even develop new technologies to achieve treatment goals.

You'd spend hours, probably days, sifting through billions of bits of useless information, just to find one thing you needed. It seems hard to imagine. Yet for many medical researchers, this frustrating experience happens when they try to use the wealth of available information on the workings of the human body. The only difference is, instead of being unable to track down a movie time or news story, when researchers lack the right search engine, it can mean the difference between a major medical breakthrough and years of wasted time and energy.This is where Dr. Robin Gras comes in. He's generating advanced artificial intelligence systems that will help researchers sort through medical and biological information.In the last few decades, we've generated enormous amounts of information on the inner workings of our bodies, from cataloguing the more than 30,000 genes than make up our genome, to complex models that explain how we think, walk, grow and do a million-and-one other things that seem pretty simple-until you look below the surface. Unfortunately, this information is only as good as the search engines that sort it. And those have not developed as fast.Essentially, Gras is developing a computerized set of rules and mathematical models that point scientists in the right direction. To understand this, think about Google: it uses rules about how websites link to one another to pick out the ones that are probably right for you.Of course, you need many more rules and a more complex model when you are trying to understand, for example, which parts of the body are involved in cancer, how they interact with one another, and which parts of this big system might be best to target for treatment. But when complete, not only will Gras's computational model aid in cancer research, it will also help researchers studying Alzheimer's, cardiovascular disease, and even mad cow disease.While the big benefit of his research-new treatments for diseases-may take a while to realize, each piece of Gras's computational puzzle will have an immediate effect, saving researchers' time and the public's money. And because the system helps make sense of complex biological interactions, it will also be useful to ecologists and others who are researching growth and change in the natural world. "

However, the availability of edible food is profoundly influenced by nature’s rhythms coming up against increasing consumption and our impact on the environment.Animals and humans are embedded in food webs (or food cycles). An organism’s position within a food web is central in determining the amount of energy and nutrients available to it and its survival. Global change can profoundly alter structures and links within food webs, ultimately changing the types and abundance of organisms that can survive in an ecosystem. Our ability to sustain healthy ecosystems and feed burgeoning populations depends on understanding how nature and humans interact with them.Dr. Aaron Fisk, Canada Research Chair in Trophic Ecology, is examining the structure, function and flow of nutrients in aquatic food webs, by using naturally-occurring and human-made chemical tracers. He is calibrating the tracers in controlled laboratory studies and applying the results in detailed field studies to questions on the structure and function of aquatic ecosystems. The tracers are also important for human and wildlife health. For example, the right combination of essential fatty acids promotes human health and fish growth, but often results in exposure to toxic mercury and PCBs.Better understanding of the influence of natural variation and of human impact on food webs is essential for effective conservation and management and for healthy and sustainable ecosystems. Fisk’s research will lead to the development of tools to study ecosystem structure and provide information on how ecosystems function and react to environmental stressors. "

But before treatments can be perfected, autism must be better understood.One piece of the puzzle is to understand how children develop their perceptions of the world, especially how they see the objects and people around them. Autistic children have significantly different impressions, but how different are they? Canada Research Chair in Social Perceptual Development, Dr. M.D. Rutherford, is planning a three-stage approach to that tricky question.His past research revealed that autistic children cannot differentiate between moving human figures and other moving, non-human objects. In his first experiment Rutherford will probe deeper into this finding by having autistic and typical children watch a computer simulation of a human-like figure. This figure will only have a dozen key points that are visible, including its head, elbows, knees and shoulders. How many of these points must move before a child realizes the figure represents a human? After he discovers this, Rutherford will then find out if there any way to get autistic children, either by themselves, or with training, to come to the same view as a typical child.Next, he will follow up on his recent research that suggests autistic children ""read"" the emotion on a person's face in a different way than normal children. Rutherford will explore how people with autism categorize facial expressions, and how this categorization may be revealed in eye movements.Finally, Rutherford will bring his past and present research together to develop a new testing procedure for autism. Autism is inheritable, so Rutherford will test the younger siblings of children with autism. He will see how these children perceive eye gaze, expressions and the movement of humans and non-human objects. Then, he'll compare these children's results to those of typical children to offer a more accurate diagnosis, and then follow up to see how accurately this test predicts the development of autism.Because no blood test exists for autism, it can only be diagnosed through screenings, which makes Rutherford's work all the more important-helping parents put to rest fears about whether their child is autistic, and for those few who test positive, offering new ways to help those children learn, develop and grow.

How we got from that stage to fully formed human beings has been played out in countless educational films, but behind those images of cells dividing and multiplying lies a big scientific mystery: how does one cell become two different cells, and how do those two become four cells, each different from the next? In other words, how do our hands and hair and brains and hearts all come from the same place?Part of the answer has to do with the ways that cells divide, something that has long fascinated Dr. Jean-Claude Labbé, Canada Research Chair in Cellular Division and Differentiation. If cells can divide at all, they usually do so as we would expect them to-by splitting into two identical copies. But some cells are special: they split into two different cells, both different from the original cell, or, in the case of stem cells, they divide into one new cell plus one cell that is a copy of the original. What makes this sort of division possible is reorganization inside the cell. Different parts move around inside the cell and organize themselves at different ends, prior the split. This type of organization is called cell polarity, and it is key not only in understanding how embryos develop into fully formed humans, but also how cancer starts-and, perhaps, how it can be stopped.But what causes cell polarity remains somewhat mysterious. Nor do scientists know what causes cell polarity to stop, and that is a major problem, because loss of cell polarity can often mean the presence of cancer, including colon cancer and breast cancer. Fortunately, Labbé has made major breakthroughs in this area, discovering several genes that are involved in cell polarity. As Canada Research Chair, he is continuing his search for these genes as well as building knowledge about the specific roles they play.In this work, Labbé willl be answering a fundamental question about why humans develop as they do, which is impressive enough, but that will not be his only contribution. By understanding how cells divide, he also hopes to learn more about how cancer spreads. This is hugely important, because it's the spread of cancer, not the original tumour, that usually kills people. In other words, not only will Labbé's research help Canadians understand more about the nature of human life, it will contribute to extending it. "

It's a tragic disease and, sadly, that statistic comes as no surprise to most of us. More than 150,000 Canadians are diagnosed every year with cancer. Over the next 20 years, a growing and aging population could mean a 60 per cent increase in the number of new cancer cases. Cancer tumours typically begin years before they're diagnosed. The mystery of how and why cancer begins is the research focus of stem cell biologist Mick Bhatia, whose study of human embryonic stem cells is being applied to understanding and treating cancer. One of the difficulties with current cancer treatment is that patients undergo aggressive chemo and radiation therapies to kill cancerous cells. Unfortunately, these procedures also destroy normal, healthy red blood cells and demolish the body's hematopoietic (blood-forming) system. Because stem cells are capable of turning into any kind of cell in the body and can develop-or differentiate-into cells with specific functions, they have great potential in therapy to replace healthy cells that have been damaged or destroyed during cancer treatment. Bhatia has made several important advancements in human stem cell research, particularly with blood stem cells. As Canada Research Chair in Human Stem Cell Biology, he is applying his understanding of their molecular nature and cell regulatory mechanisms to investigate how and why stem cells develop into other types of cells and then, how stem cells could be used as a tool kit to repair the damage caused by cancer. By studying the sequence of events that cause the development of a cancer tumour, Bhatia hopes to come up with much ""smarter"" agents for treating cancer. These therapies have the potential to change the face of cancer care and hold great promise for enhancing the quality of life for the millions of Canadians diagnosed with cancer. "

You'd get one side figured out, but then, as soon as you tried to rearrange the blocks on the second side, all your progress would be wiped out. The problem was, as you soon realized, that everything was connected-change one thing, and you change it all.The natural environment is like this, especially in the fragile ecosystem of the North, where one small change disrupts everything around it. Canada Research Chair in Aquatic Sciences and Biogeochemistry, Dr. Céline Guéguen is trying to make sense of one such puzzle, looking at how dissolved organic matter-everything from dead plants to phytoplankton-interacts with other substances in the water to have dramatic effects on Arctic rivers.Arctic rivers are distinctive for their tea-like colour, caused by tiny remains of decaying organic matter like moss and leaves. These substances are a mixed blessing: on the one hand, they block sunlight, and slow the growth of aquatic communities, but on the other hand, they also block UV rays, acting like nature's sunscreen.And, like the Rubik's cube, that's just one piece of the puzzle. Guéguen will be focusing on a different sort of interaction, examining how dissolved organic material reacts with heavy metals like mercury, released into the water by melting permafrost. A river with high levels of dissolved organic material quickly absorbs these heavy metals, and that means trouble for creatures living in that river and those who drink from it.Guéguen hopes to better understand why this rapid absorption occurs, which may allow researchers better predict how a range of pollutants flow through the water system. By solving this environmental puzzle, she'll have an immediate impact on Canada's North, allowing us to better protect its many rivers, and the thousands of plants and animals that depend on that water for survival.

It happens so quickly-and so often-that it seems to suggest that music has a special place in our brain; we seem to absorb it automatically. In fact, just like language, music is something that we all develop early in life, even without explicit tutoring. But does this mean that music is a part of our biology-that humans are naturally musical-or is music just a strong part of our culture, something that is learned like anything else? As Canada Research Chair in the Neurocognition of Music, Dr. Isabelle Peretz is working to understand that question as a part of 20-year quest to piece together the complex ways our brains respond to music. Aside from helping us understand why some people are completely tone-deaf, her research will solve some tricky questions about the nature of musical genius, and about the nature of the mind itself. Her work includes many novel experiments. In one, Peretz will try to teach children who completely lack musical ability to identify correct tone and timing. By comparing these results with children who have normal musical ability, she'll get a better sense of how much of a person's music ability is predetermined by genetics, and how much of it can be learned. In another experiment, Peretz will use brain-imaging technology to see if music and language use similar neural ""circuitry."" This will address a major scientific oversight: most research has treated music and language as separate entities, even though we don't really know if music is an offshoot of our ability to speak, or something else entirely. By understanding this, Peretz will dramatically increase our overall understanding of the human brain. Music has been common-indeed, so far as we know, universal-in every human culture since prehistoric times, but we still know very little about why humans are musical, and how musicality changes through life. Far from only being useful to record executives hunting for the next diva, Peretz's research will help psychologists studying emotion and memory, therapists designing new mood-disorder treatments, and, of course, every parent who wants to ensure their children enjoy the life-long gift of music.

Constitutional supremacy-a concept that has long been a major pillar of American political order-is now shared, in one form or another, by over 100 countries across the globe. Most of them have recently adopted a constitution or constitutional revision that contains a bill of rights and establishes some form of active judicial review, thereby empowering courts to determine the constitutionality of ""ordinary"" statutes and decrees. This global trend, which Canada joined with the adoption of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms in 1982, is arguably one of the most significant developments in 21st century government.This ""new constitutionalism "" is the research focus of Canada Research Chair Ran Hirschl. He explores the dynamic interaction between law, politics, and society as a way of thinking analytically and creatively about the origins and consequences of the new constitutionalism in Canada and abroad.The impact of the new constitutionalism has been dramatic. Almost every day, newspaper headlines report on issues such as landmark rulings of the Supreme Court of Canada, struggles over judicial appointments in the United States or constitutionalization processes in the European Union. In younger democracies, challenges related to the drafting of constitutions and establishing the authority and legitimacy of an independent judiciary occupy the political arena.Canada provides a ""living laboratory"" for Hirschl's research. Among the areas that have drawn his scholarly interest is the contribution being made by Canada's own constitutional transformation to the comparative study of legal rights and judicial review. In addition, he is fascinated by the scope, nature, and implication for democratic theory of the ""judicialization"" of politics- the ever-accelerating reliance on courts and other judicial means for addressing core moral predicaments, public policy questions, and political controversies.Through his study of various aspects of constitutionalism, including how constitutions develop, how different constitutional courts operate, and the nature and impact of jurisprudence, Hirschl is making an important contribution to the study of politics and policy-making processes worldwide.

As Canada Research Chair in Bioinformatics, part of Dr. Robert Beiko's mission is to seek out more of these incredible bacteria, and to understand how evolution has shaped their amazing capacities.Scientists know that genetics drives this appetite for toxic substances: specific genes are needed for a microbe to be able to turn contaminants into harmless by-products. Beiko is now developing better ways to search through these genes to spot which ones we may be able to put to work cleaning up the environment. And since microbes are constantly engaged in antibiotic arms races against one another, these search strategies may also be useful for discovering new antibiotic compounds to fight bacterial diseases.Aside from looking for these needle-in-a-haystack genes, Beiko's work will also help us understand how bacteria evolve. This work builds on his earlier groundbreaking discovery of gene-sharing among microbes, which potentially accelerates their ability to adapt to changing habitats.Understanding this evolutionary process may allow researchers to better combat bacteria that cause disease, such as the dreaded Staphylococcus, which has evolved into a highly virulent strain that poses significant risks to both patients and health care workers in our hospitals.With the amount of genetic information growing each year, bioinformatics-the science of getting scientific knowledge from an enormous library of biological data-is becoming more and more important.

This research has underlined the importance of the extracellular matrix (a network of non-living tissue outside the cell that provides support to cells), which regulates intercellular communication. This role is played mainly by specific proteins—known as growth factors—that interact with a wide variety of receptors on the cell surface. Dr. Gregory De Crescenzo, Canada Research Chair in Protein-Enhanced Biomaterials, is exploiting the potential of these molecular interactions by grafting bioactive growth factors on several surface types. He aims to associate the unique biological potential of these proteins to the properties of several types of polymeric materials (compounds that comprise both natural and synthetic materials) that are being used in the biomedical field. De Crescenzo aims to improve the long-term integration of vascular prostheses (which are used for the repair of injured or diseased blood vessels) by promoting tissue regeneration. He also seeks to develop new non-viral vectors (DNA delivery vehicles) to target certain cell types, as well as to increase the effectiveness of certain gene therapies.

To this end, Waddell, Canada Research Chair in Children’s Health Policy, is building a comprehensive population health strategy to promote healthy development for children, and to prevent disorders in children at risk.Mental disorders are the leading health problems faced by Canadian children, and there are marked social disparities in how children experience both the causes and the consequences of these disorders. Waddell would like to see Canadian policy-making widely adopt population health ideas, such as prevention, to address these disparities.Waddell is leading the first Canadian scientific evaluation of the landmark Nurse-Family Partnership, a primary prevention program that has the potential to reduce child maltreatment and to improve mental health and life chances for disadvantaged children.Waddell’s research on building a comprehensive population health strategy will also help ensure effective treatment for more children with mental disorders, as well as better monitoring of Canada's collective progress towards improving the lives of all children.If even a fraction of children’s mental health problems can be prevented, the benefits for children and for all Canadians will be incalculable. Waddell’s work may, ultimately,contribute to thousands more children flourishing and meeting their full potential. "

Age, gender, ethnicity, geography, and income are only a few of the more obvious ones. But the most important groupings may be the one we can't see, the one that cuts across all other groups and categorizations. Which genes we have in common with other people, and which we do not, may determine a lot more about our health and life than many other factors. In fact, we may have a lot more in common with someone on the other side of the world than we think.While every person is genetically unique, we share much of our genetic code with other people-in fact, there are common groupings of genetic codes called polymorphisms. People with certain groupings are more susceptible to diseases such as diabetes, osteoporosis or heart disease. A small subset of common polymorphisms may even alter human cell function and thus genetically predispose people to disease and explain other differences in health.But while we are getting close to mapping out every genetic grouping in our species, linking these common polymorphisms to specific altered cellular functions or particular diseases remains andecdotal. This is where Dr. Tomi Pastinen, the Canada Research Chair in Human Genomics comes in: he has spent years researching how different gene groups can determine which genes get turned on or off-an phenomenon called gene expression.In his research, Pastinen grows different human cell lines in a variety of conditions that are associated with specific human diseases. He then compares differences in cell and gene function, a crucial first step in finding out which gene groups lead to which diseases, and under what conditions.Linking common polymorphisms with large-scale functional data represents a new paradigm for genetic research and provides a treasure trove for discovery of disease-associated variation in our genomes. Pastinen's work may pave the way for understanding the underlying genetic causes of, or contributions to, a range of human diseases, ushering in a new range of lifesaving diagnostic methods and treatments.

Odds are that you haven't thought much about nitrogen, but perhaps you should. Nitrogen is essential to life: all nucleic acids and amino acids-the building blocks for DNA and proteins-contain nitrogen. Nitrogen makes up about 78 percent of our atmosphere. But most forms of life cannot use it in this molecular form. Natural usable forms are created by bacteria, which turn nitrogen into ammonia, and lightning, which creates nitric oxide. With industrialization, humans have learned how to produce usable forms. Fertilizers, for example, which contain a large amount of nitrogen, are manufactured through an artificial process similar to the one carried out by bacteria. And burning fossil fuels creates nitrogen oxides in a way similar to that of lightning. Human-made nitrogen compounds can be beneficial-as in the case of fertilizers for crops, or not-as in the case of smog, acid rain, and greenhouse gases. Canada Research Chair Jennifer Murphy wants us to know more about the nature and extent of the negative impacts of human-made nitrogen.Murphy measures trace atmospheric nitrogen compounds in various settings, such as above a snow pack, a forest, or a farmer's field. She not only quantifies nitrogen emissions, but also looks for where the emissions end up. Her research is helping to eliminate the many uncertainties that exist regarding the magnitude and distribution of nitrogen emissions in the atmosphere and their subsequent processing, dispersal, and deposition. The significance of Murphy's research is undeniable; the observations she and her research group make of human-made nitrogen compounds in the environment will be crucial to developing policies that better address climate change, pollution, and resource management.

That's because these things, although infinitesimally small, form the very building blocks of the entire world as we know it.In fact, some things, like sub-atomic particles, are so tiny that we've found them nearly impossible to observe. In the past, the main method used to understand atoms has been to smash them together and see what happens. It's a bit like throwing a baseball at a crowded auditorium, and determining what's inside by the noises you hear.As Canada Research Chair in Attosecond Photonics, Dr. Paul Corkum is developing new ways to observe atoms, molecules and other tiny particles. To do this, he is building an incredibly fast camera and flash.The flash operates using electrons which travel at one-tenth the speed of light. If a plane were travelling this fast, it would circle the globe in just one second. Unlike traditional cameras, which operate in fractions of a second, these speedy electrons allow Corkum to use a far more precise measure of time: the attosecond. One attosecond is one billionth of one billionth of a second. Because it takes just 25 attoseconds for an electron to circle an atom, Corkum's plan is to design the first 25-attosecond flashbulb. In order to create this flashbulb, he will use a laser pulse to pull an electron away from an atom, and then force it back into a collision, which produces an attosecond burst of light. Using these flashes, he will make ""movies"" of chemical and biological processes in which the actors are electrons, atoms, molecules, and light. The movie might observe what happens when a molecule undergoes a simple reaction. The laser pulse could also prod the molecules and use the movie to measure how the molecule responds. Ultimately Corkum aims to observe and control objects in the world of atoms and molecules, just as we observe and control objects in the ordinary world in which we live.Traditionally, understanding the nature of tiny molecules and atoms has been incredibly expensive and difficult. Corkum's research will provide a new, cost-effective way to learn more about these basic building blocks of matter and life, quite literally shedding light on the fundamental elements of matter. "

These ideas have influenced the modern discourse about Islam, both outside and in the Islamic world. A number of international scholars have challenged these notions. Extensive, in-depth studies have emphasized the longevity of Islamic scientific work, and the integration of Greek and other ancient scientific traditions into Islamic thought and institutions. Among these scholars is Dr. Jamil Ragep, Canada Research Chair in the History of Science in Islamic Societies. His research is contributing to our understanding of these scientific traditions in Islam. Thanks to the Canada Research Chairs Program, Ragep has expanded his widely recognized research on the history of astronomy and cosmology. He has already shown that Islamic scientific traditions lasted much longer than previously thought—from the 8th to the 19th century—making significant inroads into religious schools (madrasas) and teachings. A new relational database of his own design has allowed Ragep to document these claims more precisely. The database also serves as the basis for a wider international collaborative effort, the Islamic Scientific Manuscripts Initiative. In addition, Ragep is studying the background of the Copernican Revolution, which saw a shift in how we viewed the universe, starting with Copernicus’ claim that the sun was at its centre. By focusing on the scientific revolution’s aspects with Islamic roots, he and his collaborators will shed light on the multicultural background of modernism. By pointing to the complex historical relation between science and religion in Islamic societies, Ragep hopes that his work will contribute to today’s debate on rationalism, secularism and Islam. "

The beautiful spirals in the sky that telescopes enable us to observe were born in earlier eras of violent collisions and explosions.But despite 50 years of intense study, we do not fully understand how these cosmic wonders came to be. The problem is time. We can sit back and observe a plant or animal develop and grow, but if we used the same method for galaxies, we'd be waiting a long time-billions and billions of years, in fact.As Canada Research Chair in Astronomy and Astrophysics, Dr. Robert Thacker is working to give researchers a way to press the rewind and fast-forward buttons, returning us to the dawn of the Milky Way or jumping ahead billions of years into the future.Thacker uses computers to create virtual galaxies, whose development can be observed in just a few minutes rather than over a period of time that might have to be longer than the age of the earth. But this is no easy task: first, he must develop detailed equations that describe fundamental physical laws like gravity, then build complex models that describe other processes and interactions.These simulations create what researchers call a computational laboratory. Just like a real lab, they can use this computational lab to control different variables and change others, and then watch to see what happens. By comparing these results against what they observe in the sky, they can refine their models, and eventually develop ones that mesh exactly with what we know of real stars and galaxies.In particular, Thacker has been developing ways to understand how the birth and death of stars change the formation of galaxies. His work will help solve some great conundrums about galaxies, including the so-called nature-versus-nurture debate of whether the internal properties of galaxies determine their form, or whether the surrounding cosmic environment plays the crucial role.Aside from addressing fundamental questions about the formation of galaxies, including our own Milky Way, Thacker's research will cross-pollinate into other areas of computational science. And because the birth and death of stars plays a vital role in the creation of planets, understanding the great chain of interactions that leads to Earth-like planets will help us estimate the probability that there is life in different parts of the galaxy.

This concern has fuelled billions of dollars in spending by all levels of the Canadian government, leading to increases in criminal justice and community-based programs. Crimes of intimate partner and domestic violence have been a key target of these reforms because these victims have not, historically, had equal access to justice.As Canada Research Chair in Public Policy in Criminal Justice, Dr. Myrna Dawson is trying to find out if any of the changes have made Canadians safer. Specifically, she will be looking at the growth of domestic violence resources to see whether they can be linked to patterns in violent victimization.In the first stage of her research, Dawson will build a database documenting the growth and existence of domestic violence resources and initiatives in Canada. Currently, there are no data that systematically detail what exists and where; however, knowing regional profiles with respect to available violence prevention initiatives can contribute to our understanding of trends in violence across the country.Using this information, Dawson will identify underserved areas to determine if they also have higher rates of violence. The underlying premise is that more resources should lead to reduced exposure to violence: where resources are high, rates in violence should be low and vice versa. This information will help to better allocate funds and to ensure equal access to justice for victims. "

The fact, though, is that these technologies, and the information that comes from them about our surroundings, are used every day in everything from urban planning and road-access management to disaster-monitoring and natural-resource management. In fact, as much as 80 per cent of the information used to make civilian and military decisions has some sort of geospatial context, meaning it comes from a combination of geographical information and software that looks at space, or distances. But, although billions of dollars have been invested to collect satellite images and provide the latest geospatial information, we still don’t have effective technologies to turn these images quickly and inexpensively into the information we need. As Canada Research Chair in Advanced Geomatics Image Processing, Dr. Yun Zhang is closing the gap between the world’s geospatial information needs and what the current technology can offer. The breakthrough technologies he is developing will advance online mapping technologies and increase the capacity of Canada’s geomatics industry (the industry that creates tools and techniques for land-surveying, remote sensing, geographic information systems, global positioning systems and earth-mapping) to export remote sensing image-processing software. Several of the technologies Zhang has already developed have been licensed to world-leading geomatics companies. His automated image-fusion technique, for example, has had a significant impact on the world’s remote sensing applications, and is being used across five continents and by leading organizations including NASA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the US Geological Survey, Google Earth, Natural Resources Canada, and the Department of National Defence.

Governments in many parts of the world have selectively embraced these principles since the 1980s, though few would explicitly describe themselves as neoliberal. Always controversial, neoliberalism is a critic’s term referring to a widespread pattern of market-oriented ideas, policies and practices. Dr. Jamie Peck, Canada Research Chair in Urban and Regional Political Economy, is exploring the dynamics and contradictions of neoliberal policy development across a range of locations, networks and fields. As a governing philosophy, neoliberalism favours deregulated markets, lower taxes, privatization and restraints on public spending. It is generally promoted as good for business, competitiveness and efficiency, even though the results of neoliberal interventions have been mixed at best—and damaging for social cohesion, economic security and environmental sustainability at worst. Many believe that neoliberal policies were behind the financial crisis of 2008, and that they continue to inhibit social investment. Even so, neoliberalism has proven to be a resilient mode of governance. Peck is focusing on research projects in two areas: first, the long-term outcomes of so-called “austerity” programs for cities, which usually involve financial discipline and the reorganization of municipal governments; and second, the restructuring of labour-market regulation at the subnational scale, including the revival of “right to work” legislation and similar forms of “flexibility” policies.

However, the truth is that humans have touched all forests, if only from afar. No matter how pristine they may seem, we have to accept the reality that today healthy forests no longer happen by chance. As Canada Research Chair in Watershed Sciences, Dr. Irena Creed's job is to understand how to properly preserve Canada's forests-not just for recreational use, but for the good of people who depend on them for their livelihoods, not to mention the greater goods they supply to us all, including fresh oxygen to breathe.But how do you ensure the health of something as large and complex as a forest? Just like with humans, one way is to start with what they eat. That includes water, nutrients and, unfortunately, the pollutants that are along for the ride.Understanding this natural process requires four key steps. First, Creed and her team examine the exchanges between land, air and water, figuring out what rules govern these complex processes.Second, Creed will work to build forest-wide management principles by consolidating existing scientific research. The need for this comes from the fact that most research is small-scale, studying a single hilltop, not an entire watershed. To scale up this information, the team uses computers to blend data from airborne and satellite images, geographic surveys and a variety of simulation models.Next, Creed and her team will see how their models vary in different areas, comparing their simulations with existing data, and testing models both in controlled climate chambers and in the field.Finally, they work to understand how all these models interact with the biggest variable of them all-humans.

Many Canadians fear paralysis and disability, and for good reason: it's not just stroke or injury that trigger a neurological disorder. A growing range of diseases and viruses, including multiple sclerosis and HIV, also carry the prospect of major disability.This disability happens because of damage to nerve fibres, the delicate wiring that makes up about half of the human brain and most of the nervous system. Yet, despite their prevalence, we know little about how these fibres work, and have barely any specific treatments designed to heal these vital structures.More than affecting just movement, these fibres also play vital roles in memory. When you practice memorizing a fact, the myelin lining that surrounds these fibres grows in size, a process crucial to speeding up connections and recall. As Canada Research Chair in Axo-glial Biology, Dr. Peter Stys will lead a multi-year project to better understand nerve fibres and their myelin sheaths. Using a variety of tools, including microscopy instruments, lasers and light detectors, he'll work to decipher which biological and chemical processes account for damage and decreased functioning. With this information, better drugs and other treatments can be designed.Currently, treating neurological disorders can be an expensive, lifelong process, in good part because most treatments only address symptoms-for example, training neighbouring muscles to compensate for decreased neurological functioning. But, by understanding how nerve fibres work, researchers could be able to design more treatments that deal with the problem directly, saving millions of dollars and offering thousands of disabled Canadians the promise of a day when they could regain full use of their body or mind.

These machines, known as micro-electro-mechanical systems, or MEMS, integrate mechanical components such as sensors and motors with micro-electronics, making it possible, at least in theory, for them to perform a range of jobs in a microscopic world. As Canada Research Chair in Advanced Micro/Nanofabrication and MEMS, Dr. Kenichi Takahata wants to make sure they meet their potential.While MEMS could have huge benefits for technology in areas ranging from the health care, telecommunication, and automotive sectors to environmental and safety and security fields, they still have their drawbacks. Some of these have so far kept the technology from doing all it could. MEMS are made using semiconductor manufacturing technology, and, so far, could only be made from a narrow range of materials, limiting their mechanical abilities. They are very delicate and, in many cases, work only in controlled, clean environments. For these reasons, despite the potential these miniscule technologies have, few MEMS-based products have actually been developed and put to work.An expert in micro-/nano-fabrication and devices, Takahata has taken a revolutionary approach, diversifying the materials that MEMS can be made with, discovering new things they can potentially do, new strengths that they have, and, as a result, a whole new world of tiny—but enormous—possibilities. For example, his research has already shown that “smart” implants can be made using micro-machined stainless steel, which is both tough and compatible with biological material. These implants can allow doctors to wirelessly diagnose killer conditions such as cardiovascular disease. Drawing on his extensive industrial research experience in Japan and the United States, Takahata will lead a research program to pursue new types of MEMS using advanced materials like these, and the latest in micro-/nano-fabrication technologies.

As Canada Research Chair in Interactive Media and Performance, Dr. Charity Marsh wants to understand how, and how deeply, contemporary music cultures across western and northern Canada are influenced by these types of things. To learn more about these effects, Marsh is using several different research approaches to study the cultural politics of Canadian Aboriginal hip hop, the roles that DJs play on the Canadian prairies, and the impacts that isolation and space have on creativity, performance, and music production for artists living and working in western and northern Canada. Marsh wants to answer questions such as: What global social, political, and cultural elements have music cultures in the prairie provinces and in western and northern Canada appropriated (or adopted and then adapted) to try to connect to global stories of social and political struggle and resistance? How do local language, music and performance practices affect global hip hop and electronic dance music cultures? How does living in a wide-open land with a small, thinly spread population affect the creative and production processes of Canadian musicians? What role do interactive media and performance in western and northern Canada play in building our idea of Canada as a nation-state? Marsh is also establishing a research lab to study interactive media and performance (IMP). The IMP lab will act as a central location for intellectual discussions about, and actual creation of, cultural products, including hip hop and electronic dance music. Bringing together scholars, musicians and performers from across western and northern Canada and beyond, the lab will house a multimedia, interactive DJ studio and performance/workshop space alongside an ethnomusicology and beat-making lab, and archival materials.Marsh’s research begins by recognizing different Canadian and international experiences of how social meanings are mapped onto cultural practices, and how these practices are produced and consumed. Her research will have a significant impact on both national and international scholarship, helping us understand how cultural and regional differences in all areas of society, including the arts, are influenced by colonialism, multiculturalism, and globalization. Marsh’s analyses and research approach are also certain to provoke new thought about complex questions of resistance, authenticity and tradition. "

They finish school, have to find jobs, start independent households, form stable unions, begin new families. Yet, in countries with HIV/AIDS epidemics, young people need to do all this while trying to reduce their risks of contracting HIV/AIDS. They are not always successful. More than 40 per cent of new HIV infections happen among people under 25. Nowhere are the risks higher than in eastern and southern Africa, where, as of Dr. Shelley Clark’s appointment, HIV/AIDS rates for adults had reached 18.8 per cent in South Africa, 24.1 per cent in Botswana, and 20.1 per cent in Zimbabwe. Inside these terrible statistics, though, is even worse news for the young women fo these regions: they become infected younger than males and, in much of sub-Saharan Africa, the rate of HIV/AIDS is two to eight times higher among adolescent women than among adolescent men.Building on her research on the transition into early marriage and on girls’ risks of getting HIV in sub-Saharan Africa, Clark’s work explores how young men and women’s different paths to adulthood affect their abilities to become successful, healthy, HIV-negative adults. Rich life-course and longitudinal survey research in Kenya and Malawi is letting Clark put teens’ choices and health outcomes in the broader context of their life histories.By identifying beneficial and harmful paths, Clark’s research will help developing countries set social policies designed to promote “healthy trajectories.” The research will also help develop more effective program interventions that target critical transition periods in people’s lives.

The adaptation involves, first and foremost, modifying the transcription of the genetic information underlying the proteins concerned. Abnormal regulation of transcription can cause uncontrolled multiplication or irregular transformation of cells, and this can trigger many diseases, including various forms of cancer. This explains why chairholder Dr. Amine Nourani, professor in the Faculty of Medicine of Université Laval, is endeavouring to shed light on the basic processes used by cells to transcribe the target genes. He is especially interested in chromatin, a structure composed of proteins and nucleic acids. To study transcriptional regulation, the researcher has to factor in the dynamic role of chromatin, which compresses DNA in the nucleus of cells and adds a new level of complexity to the transcriptional regulation of genetic information. However, as they have evolved, cells have established mechanisms to enable the transcription process to coexist with this structure. Nourani’s work is based on genetic, biochemical and genomic approaches using a variety of organisms as models. His research will generate a deeper understanding of the functioning of human cells, and, ultimately, of the mechanisms causing many diseases. It could also pave the way for innovative therapies. "

Today, it’s not yet possible to cure this disease, but a few of the symptoms can be alleviated, thanks to antipsychotic medications. Schizophrenia and the large number of closely related psychoses cause patients and their families enormous distress, and have a very high cost for Canadian society.The schizophrenic’s brain, like everyone else’s, has neurotransmitters that communicate information between different areas of the brain. Two of these systems, the dopamine and glutamate systems, play roles in the biology of schizophrenia. However, even though incredible advances have been made in recent years, precise knowledge of nerve cells, their relationships, and their exact roles in integrated functions still represent a black box for modern neurobiology.As Canada Research Chair in Neurobiology of Mental Disorders, Dr. Bruno Giros has been a pioneer in the molecular characterization, cloning and study of a large number of dopamine and glutamate receptors and transporters. These represent some of the main targets for widely used psychotropic drugs. He is also one of the leading scientists developing the first genetic models in mice that could allow us to link these molecules to integrated brain functions, and let us model certain types of psychosis.Bringing together both fundamental research and clinical needs, Giros’ studies will keep focusing on the molecular networks made up of dopamine and glutamate receptors and transporters.This comprehensive knowledge will let researchers develop and study refined animal models and identify new drug targets for antipsychotic medications for schizophrenia and other brain disorders and diseases. His work may help patients live relatively normal lives, and could eliminate some of the societal costs of a still-mysterious disorder that turns far too many young Canadian lives upside down. "

However, problems remain in tapping the sun’s energy. For example, how do we harness the power of the sun into a sustainable energy source, let alone harness the parts of sunlight we can’t even see?Dr. Karin Hinzer, Canada Research Chair in Photonic Nanostructures and Integrated Devices, is finding answers by creating more efficient solar cells that will convert the broader spectrum of light into electricity. This requires capturing and fine-tuning wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation that are invisible to the human eye, such as ultraviolet and infrared.The typical solar cell is silicon-based and captures only one band on the light spectrum. As a result, most solar cells only convert about 20 per cent of the energy that hits them into electricity. Hinzer is working to capture the entire solar spectrum, which will boost solar cell performance by allowing the cells to absorb more energy. She has collaborated with researchers, government and industry partners to create marketable solar energy products that are currently up to 40 per cent efficient. Hinzer is now aiming for even higher efficiencies. In addition, Hinzer is providing comprehensive training to those she mentors, which will be passed on to industry.Hinzer’s research could result in a technological revolution for renewable solar energy.

But it is not known how and to what extent these factors may play a role.Dr. Aleck Ostry, Canada Research Chair in the Social Determinants of Community Health, aims to find the answers. Through the use of census data and interviews, Ostry is examining the factors that constitute a strong social fabric, and how these differ between urban and rural communities. He is also investigating what happens to a community and its support networks after an economic blow.In addition, Ostry is researching Canadian food policy and then linking this research to community health. He believes current healthy eating and lifestyle messages designed for the public are falling on the wrong ears. While more educated and affluent people can afford to change their habits, those in lower income and education brackets don’t have the means to make those healthy changes.Ostry aims to tackle these issues through his research. Ostry has also developed national and international research partnerships to develop his research programs and to ensure that they will be relevant in policy-making. The importance of social and economic factors in creating healthy communities has received short shrift. Greater awareness about the social factors that determine people’s health could lead to better public policy. By addressing these kinds of inequalities, Ostry’s research could help lead to a world with healthier people and communities. "

In fact, there’s a lot going on in their worlds. Recent research suggests they have intense exchanges with their environment long before they can ever talk. And it seems babies are especially interested in learning about actions—others’, their own and the outcomes of them. As Canada Research Chair in Cognitive Development, Dr. Petra Hauf is studying how infants learn to understand actions during infancy and early childhood. Specifically, she is looking at how infants’ perceptual and motor development affects how and when they make their own actions and their ability to perceive and understand the actions others make. Using eye-tracking and video technology she is also researching what other features are linked to babies’ development. Studying infants, Hauf has discovered that, in their first year of life, they not only learn about actions while watching others but that the actions they make themselves affect how interested they are in those made by others. Understanding this two-way relationship is key to more advanced understanding of actions, goals and communication. Hauf’s research focuses on the relationship between perceptual and motor development and how these affect how well normally developed infants are able to think. Used to develop training programs for infants and young children with developmental delays, though, it could help every child become the best they can be. "

Overcoming microbial drug resistance not only requires designing new drugs but also a better understanding of how resistance develops in the first place. Cowen, the Canada Research Chair in Microbial Genomics and Infectious Disease, is examining the mechanisms by which microbes evolve drug resistance and cause infectious disease—a leading cause of premature death around the world. Microbes have the alarming ability to quickly evolve new capabilities in order to survive antibiotic treatments and invade human bodies. By exploring how microbes sense stressful environments, such as the presence of toxic drugs or a vigilant set of immune cells, Cowen is working to uncover the crucial cellular response pathways that underlie how new survival strategies evolve in disease-causing (or “pathogenic”) microbes.Cowen uses specialized genomic technology to identify the key determinants that enable this evolution in different fungal pathogens. Fungi are chief among the opportunistic invaders that attack weakened hosts, causing disease mainly among people whose immune systems are compromised due to organ transplants, HIV infection or chemotherapy for cancer.Focusing on two of the leading fungal pathogens attacking humans, Candida albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus, Cowen studies the molecular mechanisms that microbes use to adapt to stressful environments. Understanding these mechanisms will allow new strategies to be developed to treat fungal infectious diseases. By investigating how infected cells respond to invading fungal pathogens, Cowen is also uncovering both general responses to pathogens and specific interactions between pathogen cells and host cells. Her research will generate new strategies to improve our self-defense against these invaders. "

Their success has inspired the research community to tackle the work of identifying genetic risk factors underlying more common diseases such as heart disease and stroke—both long recognized as conditions with genetic components. To date, however, the search hasn’t proved as successful as expected because the factors leading to the development of these diseases are more complex. In response, genetic epidemiologists, such as France Gagnon at the University of Toronto, are calling for tailored study designs and specially adapted analytic strategies to accomplish their goal. Gagnon, as the Canada Research Chair in Genetic Epidemiology, has developed a research program that focuses on the genetic factors underlying complex traits, which she then characterizes at the population level. Her work demands that she collect data on both the biological and environmental factors for these diseases in specific populations, such as large families. She is particularly interested in people who have venous thromboembolism (a blood clot in a vein).In the course of her research, Gagnon is providing invaluable leadership in the new integrative discipline of genetic epidemiology. Together with the work of her colleagues, Gagnon’s research will lead to identification of the individuals, families and populations that are at risk of developing certain common disorders, and thus help prevent, diagnose and treat these often life-threatening diseases.

This immediate response is designed to prevent the invading pathogen from travelling any deeper into our tissues. The sensors trigger inflammatory mediators, the secretion of anti-microbial peptides, and the recruitment of a battery of immune cells to help fight off infection. Certain pathogens, however, especially food-borne bacteria such as salmonella and listeria, are somehow able to evade these sensors and pass through our natural defence barrier unhindered. Canada Research Chair Stephen Girardin wants to know exactly how the pathogens manage to do this. In pursuit of his goal, Girardin works with a recently discovered family of intracellular protein sensors called the Nod-like receptors, which can recognize bacterial cell-wall components and are known to play key roles in innate immunity by triggering inflammatory pathways when they detect invading pathogens. Acting like molecular sentinels against infection, the Nod-like receptors regulate inflammation and the immune defences at the level of mucosal surfaces, such as the intestine, and they may be involved in Crohn’s disease, a debilitating inflammation of the intestine that is believed to be an autoimmune disorder. In Girardin’s lab, he and his colleagues dissect the signalling pathways that are triggered by Nod-like receptors once they detect the incoming microbe. In addition, the scientists work on identifying new sensors in the family of Nod-like receptors and exploring how pathogenic bacteria have evolved to escape our body’s innate immunity.Girardin’s research is not only broadening our understanding of various food-borne human diseases but is also clarifying the mechanisms that lead to certain important inflammatory disorders at the mucosal surfaces.

Without hearing the sound of a voice at the other end, jokes turn into groaners and communications get muddled. But these are far from the only ways that sounds affects us every day.As Canada Research Chair in Voice Biomechanics and Mechanobiology, Dr. Luc Mongeau is working to enhance our understanding of sound, studying things we’d expect—like improving hearing aids and helping people with damaged voices—and a few things we probably wouldn’t, including a novel way that sound can act as a refrigerator.One of the more immediate impacts of Mongeau’s work could be in the operating room, where his computer-generated models could help surgeons operating on people with damaged vocal chords. That may sound like a rare problem, but many people—actors, singers, public speakers and even the occasional boisterous fan—can develop a common voice condition called nodules. These are similar to blisters on the vocal folds, the two lips of soft tissue in the larynx that oscillate to create sound. Mongeau’s models could help make the surgery to repair this problem more effective, and may even lead to new therapies or prosthetic devices.Similar models of sound could also be valuable in dealing with another common but not often talked about problem: hearing damage. Causes can include not only obvious culprits like noise from airplanes or loud machinery, but also some surprisingly dangerous but frequent problems, including the loud noises hearing aids transmit on windy days.Other applications for Mongeau’s research are even more unique, including using sound waves in something called “thermo-acoustic refrigeration,” a way toof supercharge traditional refrigeration achieveing cooling from high -amplitude sound wavesand, at the same time, make it more which that is environmentally friendly, by using less power and limitingeliminatingsince it eliminates the need for refrigerant.Even if these cool ideas do not reach the market for years, Mongeau’s research will have an immediate impact. In an aging society where hearing aids may soon be as commonplace as glasses, Mongeau’s deep understanding of sound will help elderly Canadians stay engaged with their families, while helping the rest of us hear and speak more clearly, promoting one of the most important of all Canadian qualities—basic understanding.

One mathematician who shares in this time-honoured fascination is Stephen Kudla, currently the Canada Research Chair in Automorphic Forms and Arithmetic Geometry. As a Canada Research Chair, Kudla is continuing his work in arithmetic mathematics. He maintains that most important recent advances in this area of mathematics have been achieved by establishing connections between integer solutions of polynomial equations and automorphic forms to which analytic techniques may be applied. He himself is focusing on a new approach to establish such connections, one that is based on the construction of generating series for arithmetic cycles. His technique provides a method for calculating important number theoretic quantities, including arithmetic volumes that were unattainable by earlier methods. Kudla believes that arithmetic geometry should be of interest to all of us, not only because of its applications to cryptography and computer science, but also because it provides a deeper understanding of the structure of the world. His view is based on the idea that the patterns of mathematics are just as much a part of the fundamental structure of the universe as are the laws of particle or quantum physics. And just as astronomers peer through ever more powerful telescopes for faint traces of the origins of the physical universe, mathematicians like Kudla peer into the hidden mysteries of our world with chalk on blackboard.

For the cortex and, therefore, a human being to function normally, groups of cells must work together as networks. This is normally controlled by neurotransmitters, such as serotonin, acetylcholine and dopamine. If the cortex develops abnormally, however, the recruitment of neurons into a network or the modulation of network activity may become disordered. It is thought this might be what happens in a variety of serious conditions, such as schizophrenia, epilepsy and autism. The process may also be indirectly involved with attention deficit disorder. Since developmental changes in brain circuitry related to the cortex and their modulation by neurotransmitters are not yet fully understood, Evelyn Lambe, Canada Research Chair in Developmental Cortical Physiology, is studying them further. In her lab, Lambe and her colleagues are using a combination of electrophysiological, imaging, pharmacological and molecular approaches to investigate network activity in the cortex. Lambe believes that by examining windows of vulnerability in the cortex’s maturation, she will better understand what goes wrong in the brain to produce neurological and psychiatric disorders. Lambe is also exploring the potential of various environmental and molecular treatments to correct abnormal development, thereby contributing to the creation of drug tools to improve brain function in people with neurodevelopmental disorders.

Disturbances in matrix remodelling also have an enormous impact on society, with arthritis alone responsible for $4.4 billion in health-care costs in Canada each year. But how do matrix dynamics actually work? For Christopher McCulloch that’s the big question. As the Canada Research Chair in Matrix Dynamics, he is working with a multi-disciplinary team examining the fundamental mechanisms that regulate matrix remodelling, in particular how cells “talk” to each other. McCulloch and his colleagues study the signalling pathways that regulate matrix remodelling, particularly in inflammatory disorders, such as arthritis, where either matrix destruction or matrix over-production leads to loss of tissue function. They use state-of-the-art technologies with carefully selected models of matrix remodelling that address each investigator’s hypotheses. In the process, they are identifying the intersecting regulatory systems that ultimately determine the contribution of matrix dynamics to health and disease. What they learn will provide opportunities for therapies that can treat a variety of serious diseases. McCulloch’s research is also having a tangible impact on training highly qualified personnel. Since connective-tissue matrix diseases are common, they have become the focus of considerable efforts to develop drugs. As a result, research training in matrix signalling is giving graduate students a substantial advantage when looking for work in the pharmaceutical industry. "

But what also makes nanotechnology unique is its ability to combine living and non-living materials into one integrated machine.Even without this combination, nanotechnology has amazing applications: nanowires that detect DNA sequences, nanotubes that deliver drugs or destroy cancer cells, and biomolecules that scientists can use as blueprints to create next-generation nano-sized objects. But the true promise of nanotechnology will only be realized when we discover better ways to combine the inorganic materials, like nanowires and nanotubes, with organic materials, including proteins and nucleic acids. Only then can we create machines that are as complex—or perhaps even more complex—than the countless normal-sized machines and technologies we use each day.Dr. Tian Tang, Canada Research Chair in Nano-biomolecular Hybrid Materials, is developing new ways to understand how nano-sized organic and inorganic materials interact. Although the materials are fundamentally different—one is living, the other not—similar rules of physics govern their interactions. But these rules interact in complex and varying ways: at any time, numerous forces, including electrostatic interaction, elastic force, entropy and adhesive forces, can all be having an effect on the nanostructures.Sorting out which forces apply where, and how, is key to being able to advance nanotechnology. To gain this understanding, Tang uses a variety of computer simulations, some of which attempt to provide a realistic, atom-by-atom picture of what is happening in interactions. Other computer simulations take this complex information and strip it down to representations of key processes.With this information, Tang will develop new models and computational tools that will help reduce the time needed to design and engineer nano-biomolecular hybrid materials. Ideally, this will help scientists better use the remarkable self-assembling nature of molecules, which, under the right conditions, automatically join up in predictable combinations, saving scientists from having to stack them together piece by piece like toy blocks when building nanomachines. By harnessing these remarkable self-assembly processes and combining them with our ability to make a range of useful nano-sized materials, we will be able to have the best of both worlds, producing new nano-sized machines that will be useful in electronics, computing, manufacturing and health. Tang’s research will also help ensure Canada is at the forefront of this field, which is expected to be one of the most commercially important and fastest-moving areas of heath and engineering in the 21st century.

Yet, as unsettling as these events were, they’d be nothing compared to the consequences of a contagious pathogen attacking something more fundamental to our survival—basic food crops.It’s happened before, most memorably during the Irish Potato Famine, when a pathogen caused a crop failure that forced two million to flee their country and left another one million to starve. As Canada Research Chair in Plant-Microbe Systems Biology, Dr. Darrell Desveaux is working to prevent similar catastrophes, but to do this, he has to overcome one big problem: scientists still do not know where pathogens get their deadly power to take over a plant’s defences. Understanding this means understanding what happens at the molecular level when pathogens attack.Desveaux's research target is Pseudomonas syringae, a pathogen that damages crops worldwide, including tomatoes, apples and soybeans. It even attacks two Canadian icons: maple trees and wheat. The genome of this pathogen has been sequenced and, by studying it as it attacks a model plant called Arabidopsis thaliana—which has also had its genome sequenced—Desveaux's work aims to indentify how pathogens affect a plant’s biological systems, including its genes, proteins and cells.With the world’s population set to top 9 billion by 2050, food is likely to be in ever-shorter supply, making the consequences of crop diseases all the more severe—and all the more expensive to a major agricultural exporter like Canada. As the first step to a strategy to control agricultural diseases, Desveaux’s work will help prevent famines and economic losses, and give more security to Canadian farmers—who already have enough to do without wondering whether pathogens will destroy their livelihoods.

In fact, about four per cent of the population suffers from a form of snoring so extreme that it could actually kill them. Called obstructive sleep apnea, the condition occurs when muscles controlling respiration relax, causing the airway to close. Repeated attempts to breathe in are prevented until oxygen levels fall so low that the sleeper wakes up. At this point, muscle function and breathing go back to normal, but heart rate and blood pressure surge. And the cycle can happen hundreds of times each night. As Canada Research Chair in Sleep and Respiratory Neurobiology, Dr. Richard Horner is trying to understand how this problem happens in the first place—a key step toward an effective treatment. Finding that treatment is no small matter—obstructive sleep apnea causes strokes and heart attacks that contribute to premature death, often when sufferers are only in their 40s or 50s. Just as seriously, the condition can lead to debilitating daytime sleepiness, one of the causes of car accidents and other injuries. In financial terms, obstructive sleep apnea costs North Americans tens of billions of dollars each year. Horner looks to the brain seeking to understand why it signals respiratory muscles to relax. Understanding the cellular and neurological causes of sleep apnea, is a crucial first step to finally developing drugs to treat the condition. In the process of his research, Horner is also answering fundamental questions about sleep, respiration and neurobiology. His work may also shed light on other conditions involving muscle movement, including motor-neuron diseases like ALS and muscular dystrophy, as well as conditions like spinal cord injury. Even if these extra offshoots come much later, the immediate results—a better understanding of snoring, particularly in its most dangerous form—will be benefit enough. "

It also plays a crucial role in the life of plants, allowing forests to produce oxygen and wood, absorb carbon dioxide and provide wildlife habitats. As well, water plays a critical role in crop production, by allowing agricultural crops to feed the planet’s growing population.How do plants optimize the use of this vital resource when they are exposed to different abiotic conditions (factors in the environment like sunlight, temperature and rain that affect ecosystems)? Dr. Uwe Hacke, Canada Research Chair in Tree-Water Relations, is using a variety of approaches to study this issue. Hacke is examining the molecular control of water uptake by roots and the dynamics of xylem transport (the system of tubes and transport cells that circulates water and dissolved minerals in plants). He is also exploring stomatal (microscopic pores on plant surfaces) control of water loss in leaves.Hacke is aiming to identify traits that would enable the breeding of more drought-tolerant plants that could grow under a wide variety of environmental conditions. He is also seeking to understand how drought causes forest dieback (higher than usual mortality of trees and plants) in Canada and other parts of the world. Given our changing climate, Hacke’s research on water and drought conditions has major practical implications on plant and forest life. "

Yet, strange as it sounds, this was the first experiment to detect neutrinos, amazing sub-atomic particles that could unlock many of the mysteries of the universe.Since then, the field of neutrino astrophysics has exploded, and for good reason: neutrinos are not only among the most abundant sub-atomic particles in the universe, they also have the amazing power to pass through just about anything, even stars, so observing and understanding them could give us new insights into the furthest reaches of space. Similar to electrons, but without any electric charge, neutrinos get their amazing powers because they only interact very weakly with other particles, something that also makes them difficult to detect.As Canada Research Chair in Astroparticle Physics, Dr. Aksel Hallin hopes to use neutrinos to solve many of the big problems of contemporary astrophysics, including the curious fact that only four or five per cent of the universe’s mass comes from atoms, and most of the rest comes from dark energy and dark matter.As in those earlier experiments, Hallin must look for answers in a laboratory located deep underground. Since neutrinos can penetrate rocks, something other particles can’t do, underground labs allow researchers to observe neutrinos in relative isolation. Hallin’s self-designed lab is especially notable because it reduces levels of dust and radon gas to below their natural levels. This is important because dark matter and neutrinos only rarely interact, so when they do, scientists do not want their observations masked by radiation, dust or radon.Already, Hallin and his team have been able to measure neutrinos and to demonstrate that they change character and have mass. A further understanding of neutrinos could explain the difference in the amounts of matter and antimatter in the universe, and would be a step toward the ultimate understanding of matter: the still-elusive unified particle field theory. Accomplishments in this field could bring international scientific acclaim to Canada, and change our understanding of the world as we know it. "

As a result, it is a primary locus of cultural cross-fertilization, particularly as it pertains to health care factors. In this context, it is not surprising that the health of immigrants, who make up almost 20 per cent of the population, is of concern to our leaders and to health care professionals, especially since it seems to have deteriorated over the years. It is also clear why Canadians’ love affair with complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) and with natural products—an estimated 70 per cent of the population is currently using them—deserves to be a full-fledged research field generating more than the reductionist explanations often proffered regarding the purpose of such therapies. Chairholder Dr. Laurence Monnais, who specializes in the history of colonial medicine and of Vietnamese health care practices, plans to examine these two issues by studying health care pluralism from an historical perspective. This will give her a better understanding of changes in the health care practices of ethnocultural communities and of changes in the health care practices of the Canadian population as a whole in light of the immigration experience.One of her objects of research will be the content of statements on health care pluralism and CAM (including traditional medicine) that have been made by decision-makers, health care professionals, patients and health care consumers in a number of countries since the advent of “modern” medicine in the 19th century. She also intends to conduct a comparative analysis of the pluralistic practices adopted by various communities and their members as well as the socio-cultural and socio-historical factors underlying these practices. In addition, she plans to examine the relationships between the statements of the various stakeholders and the practices adopted and to study their impact on health care policy, medical systems, medicalization processes and individual health and wellness practices.As well as making a very useful contribution to the debate on the future of Canada’s health care systems, Monnais’ work will generate a more accurate assessment of what the role of CAM and traditional medicine should be, thereby meeting individuals’ expectations while continuing to improve the health of the Canadian population as a whole.

But despite the status of obesity as a significant public health problem, research into how it is managed within the health system is currently very limited. As in many other countries, obesity rates in Canada are increasing, particularly in the Atlantic provinces. Understanding how we can manage excessive weight gain from the perspective of the people concerned and their health-care providers will help to develop effective interventions for both prevention and treatment.Having spent a number of years working as a dietician in the United Kingdom’s National Health Service before embarking on a career in academic research, Dr. Sara Kirk, Canada Research Chair in Health Services Research, is an expert in weight management. Kirk’s research aims to explore how the health-care system, as well as individuals themselves, can be better prepared to tackle excessive weight gain. Kirk’s research explores how the obesogenic environment—an environment that leads people to become excessively overweight—influences weight gain in Nova Scotia and how obesity is currently managed. A key outcome of her work will be to determine whether it is possible to intervene earlier to prevent obesity, as well as to develop targeted interventions for managing obesity more effectively. Kirk’s team will also be working closely with health-care providers to apply new technologies for delivering support and advice around weight management, including web-based systems for support, training and surveillance. Tackling excessive weight gain is a major challenge, but Kirk’s research will provide timely insights and the much-needed research evidence required to better manage this major public health problem.

But, in order for everything from pharmaceutical drugs to energy-storage devices to work, very important things have to happen at the sub-microscopic level. For these devices to work even better in the future, we need to understand what is happening inside them, at the smallest possible level. As Canada Research Chair in Computational Chemical Dynamics, Dr. Tucker Carrington is working to understand these almost impossibly small processes, with the goal of improving the efficiency of thousands of everyday devices. The motion of atoms and molecules determines many things, including the rate of chemical relations, how energy gets transferred among molecules, and how molecules and atoms respond to light. This last interaction with light is particularly important: understanding how light interacts with molecules allows us to determine the size, shape and stiffness of those molecules. Only once we determine these basic facts can we really advance our understanding of the motion of atoms and molecules. This motion and these interactions are guided by the rules of quantum mechanics, laws of physics so complex that the most powerful computers have trouble solving the associated equations, and the most powerful minds have trouble explaining the science in a way that non-specialists can understand. By developing new computational techniques, Carrington will make it possible to study bigger and more complex molecular systems. This research is a crucial step toward understanding why many of the devices we use actually work, and how they can be improved. This understanding will revolutionize everything from drug design to renewable energy, paving the way for countless advances in the quality—and length—of life. "

His work has special importance for an aging population, particularly older men, many of whom will experience distressing urinary systems caused by an enlarged prostate.Nickel’s work, which is already helping patients and doctors, involves further developing an improved system to identify and classify these conditions. This will allow for better diagnosis, and, more importantly, better monitoring of treatment. This monitoring could save millions of dollars, and is already confirming that many current treatments, despite being widely recommended, are not, in fact, widely successful. Nickel will also work with fellow Queen’s University researchers to develop and pilot new treatments. Because this area of study is just now being developed, these studies will be wide-ranging, investigating treatments that focus on the nervous and immune systems; that involve hormone, physio- and psychotherapy; and that use sexual therapy and non-traditional therapies like herbal medicine.Urological pain and inflammation currently rob millions of Canadians of their quality of life, and, left unchecked, promise to become an even bigger problem as our population ages.

Recently, another virus—H5N1—has jumped from birds to humans. This virus could become highly aggressive and allow human-to-human transmission, leading to a worldwide influenza pandemic.It’s hard to find a cure for a constantly mutating virus, so immunologist Dr. Eleanor Fish takes a different approach. Her focus isn’t on the virus itself, but on our immune system’s reaction to it. As the Canada Research Chair in Women’s Health and Immunobiology, Fish is working to create small-molecule drugs to give our immune systems a big boost to fight off viruses. These drugs aren’t focused on a specific virus, but on specific features of our immune system that will fight any infecting virus, making them a one-size-fits all solution.Specifically, Fish studies interferons (IFNs), a family of antiviral proteins that help cells fight viruses by invoking responses in cells to attack the viruses at different stages in their life cycles. She is currently developing a type of super IFN with boosted antiviral activity. Fish is also targeting other critical parts of the human host that viruses absolutely need for infection but that humans don’t really need for survival. Her strategy is to develop a panel of broad-spectrum antiviral drugs that are affordable, stable and can be distributed worldwide—especially to the developing world, which is most at risk for pandemic virus infections.It’s important to note that men and women respond differently to infections. A key aspect of Fish’s research is to understand these sex differences in order to provide better treatments. Her studies of hormonal and chromosomal differences—and how these affect disease susceptibility—also have implications for autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis, which mostly affect females. By understanding what makes people susceptible to such diseases, Fish hopes to develop targeted drugs that will provide better treatment for both women and men, whether against a virus infection or an autoimmune disease.

Proteins interact with other proteins, forming a cascade of cellular events that guide the formation of tissue and organs. The cellular mechanisms that control embryo development, however, are often the same ones that malfunction in cancers. Dr. Stephane Angers, Chair of Functional Architecture of Signal-Transduction Complexes, wants to find out how these signals work, and how they go wrong in human disease. Angers is honing in on two of the most important of these signals, the Wnt and Hedgehog proteins, which are secreted around the cell and then integrated by pathways inside the cell. Using cutting-edge protein proteomic, biophysical and biochemical tools, Angers traces the proteins that take part in integrating the Wnt and Hedgehog signals and figures out how they work to produce a co-ordinated cellular response. Angers also studies E3 ubiquitin ligases, which are major regulators of protein stability in cells. These ligases are enzymes that earmark proteins and send them to be destroyed when they need to be, such as when they malfunction or are subverted by viruses. This can lead to a wide range of diseases, including cancer, or to infections, so understanding what makes the proteins behave in certain ways, is vital. By shedding light on the normal function of these cellular tools, Angers is laying the groundwork to develop new strategies that steer molecular communication onto the right path and keep our bodies healthy and disease-free.

It’s hard to believe that life goes on without the sun, but geologist Dr. Barbara Sherwood Lollar, working with an international team from Taiwan, the United States and Germany, reported the first direct evidence that communities of microbes known as chemolithotrophs survive by using hydrogen and minerals deep inside crystalline rocks. Sherwood Lollar and her group collected samples from mines in South Africa and Canada and analyzed them in her Stable Isotope Laboratory. Through this research, she found that the gases deep within the Earth can support life. And it’s possible that if life exists or existed on other planets, like Mars, it may be or have been fed by similar deep chemical processes. Closer to home, Sherwood Lollar is also working on removing pollutants, such as petroleum hydrocarbons and chlorinated solvents, from our rural and urban groundwater.

Dr. Nancy Reid, the Canada Research Chair in Statistical Theory and Applications, has made a career of statistics and is a leader in the area of statistical inference—drawing conclusions about people or processes from large and complex sets of data. As modern technology has made collecting data easier, tools for getting the best possible information out of these data are becoming ever more important. At the same time, scientific knowledge is becoming more and more specialized, as scientists focus on finding specific solutions to specific problems. As a statistician, Reid is a sort of jack of all trades, helping solve complex, data-rich problems in areas as diverse as particle physics and air quality.

Protests, taking such forms as riots in the suburbs and anti-violence marches, are a reflection of social problems that people are endeavouring to put on the national agenda. Chairholder Dr. Catherine Trudelle is trying to gain a deeper understanding of socio-territorial processes and territorial management by focusing her analysis on conflict as a source of socioterritorial change. This will involve developing methods to understand and draw a broad profile of conflict in a variety of living environments and producing comparative scientific knowledge on the phenomenon. In all parts of the world, metropolitanization is leading to the emergence of groups of urbanized territories forming new living environments. This can destabilize local democracy by enlarging the social space of individuals at the same time as they have to deal with issues of greater complexity. Furthermore, new territorial processes and relationships are restructuring living environments. These developments and the resulting conflicts are putting democracy to the test, because they establish the right to respect—a right being demanded by people from all socio-economic backgrounds and all territories. Pluralist societies are prospering and social models are becoming more diverse, with the result that new governance practices reflect changes in the way power is being exercised. These practices are related to co-ordination processes enabling people to participate in building their society even though they enjoy varying degrees of power. As they learn how to engage in collective action, social groups with less power can become more adept at articulating and promoting their views and rights.Trudelle’s research is of fundamental importance because it will serve to identify and describe components of socio-territorial prediction that can provide the inhabitants of a territory with guidance as well as tools and methods for conflict resolution and can suggest future directions for public policy on territorial development and management that reflects the broad range of community needs.

Since this disease is caused by disruption of certain cellular processes, it is essential to understand the mechanisms that ensure their smooth functioning. Many cellular processes act on the structural dynamics of chromosomes to control the expression of genes (contained in the chromosomes), their repair and transmission. In his research, Professor Côté is seeking to better understand how the proper functioning of the human genome (the entire collection of chromosomes) is ensured in the various cells. It has long been known that certain epigenetic factors (not connected with DNA) make it possible for different tissues to form in human beings, even though the same genetic information (DNA) is found in all cells in the organism. Each type of cell must play its own role, in a carefully ordered manner. It is therefore necessary to ensure gene regulation, determining how each cell must express the proteins that are needed and suppress those that are not needed. A disturbance of this process may lead cells to malfunction, die or proliferate uncontrollably—as happens in cancer. Professor Côté’s research will help to better understand the mechanisms that control the functioning and stability of the human genome. In addition, since this research is directly linked with many types of cancerous tumours, the findings, combined with technology, will make it possible to create better diagnostic and therapeutic tools.

During embryonic development, cells develop into different tissues and organs through tiny changes in cell form, movement and function—a process known as cell polarity. However, certain molecules and genes can cause cell polarity to malfunction, leading embryos to develop abnormally. The same molecules and genes involved in cell polarity also lead to over 80 per cent of human cancers.What causes these glitches in the first place? That’s what Dr. Brian Ciruna hopes to discover as Canada Research Chair in Developmental Genetics and Cell Biology. And he’ll get answers by studying zebrafish embryos, which are not only remarkably similar to humans’, but are also abundant, transparent and easily grown under the microscope.Ciruna has pioneered two techniques to use in his research. First, he captures images of zebrafish cell movement. Second, he can turn the molecules and genes that may control cell polarity on or off. By manipulating zebrafish embryos and watching the results, Ciruna is gradually building an understanding of what underlies the process of cell polarity, an understanding he can then apply to the spread of cancerous cells. More than the tumour, it is this spread of cancerous cells, called metastasis, that usually causes death.This understanding will give new hope to many cancer sufferers, and to the millions of Canadians who will be diagnosed during their lifetime. Understanding the spread of cancer—not just its cause—is vital, since tumours and the cells that cause them often remain, even after successful treatments.

But tumour cells are like rabid wolves: they grow uncontrolled and don’t respond to normal cues. Cells go “rogue” because of mutations that enable a single cell to evolve, multiply and cause cancer. Dr. Linda Penn, Canada Research Chair in Molecular Oncology, is working to target tumour cells at two levels. First, she is trying to better understand a particularly potent and prevalent cancer-causing mutation that results in an over-abundance of a molecule called Myc. If Penn’s group can understand how Myc drives cancer growth, they will be in a strong position to exploit the unusually high levels of Myc found only in tumour cells. They can use this abnormality as a weapon to destroy the tumour cell. To this end, Penn and her team have developed many new technologies. Second, Penn is trying to understand how the statin family of drugs stops cancerous growth. Currently used as cholesterol-control agents, statins can trigger tumour cell death without harming neighbouring normal cells. If Penn’s lab can understand how this works, it can determine how this readily available drug could be used as an anti-cancer agent in patient care. "

This is evident in the tremendous surge in demand for wireless and mobile communications services, such as cellular communications, instant messaging and wireless local area networks (WLANs). In addition, wired technology has advanced to the point where people expect very highspeed real-time services in the home and elsewhere. Therefore, we need new wireless communications systems that use low-cost, intelligent portable devices and that operate in a variety of hostile environments while providing a positive user experience. The need to interact and participate in a community is very strong, and wireless devices allow a level of connectivity that was unimaginable a generation ago. The impact of new wireless systems and devices on our social and economic future cannot be understated. Dr. Aaron Gulliver, Canada Research Chair in Advanced Wireless Communications, is a world leader in wireless communications. He has developed innovative techniques for efficient, robust, low-complexity communications systems that are currently in use throughout the world. Tomorrow’s communications systems will deliver high data rate communications; will be efficient in both power and bandwidth; will provide high-quality reliable connections; will allow access anywhere, anytime, over a wide service area; and will provide diversified, easy-to-use services. Gulliver’s research is focused on several key enabling technologies that will bring tomorrow here sooner. But to meet the surging demands for services such as wireless multimedia, we must do more with existing resources. Currently, only about 10 per cent of the available spectrum is in use at any given time. How can users fairly and efficiently use free bandwidth? What happens when ultra-wideband systems allow low-power communications over a wide range of frequencies? Will this mean we can eliminate all wired household communications? By addressing these issues, Gulliver’s algorithms and techniques will bring Canadians even closer to each other and ever closer to people around the world. "

Dr. Andras Nagy, Canada Research Chair in Stem Cells and Regeneration, is interested in manipulating blood vessels as a potential cancer treatment. A growth factor called VEGF is essential for the growth of blood vessels. Blocking VEGF with drugs starves the cells fed by the vessels. This is good news if the cells in question are cancerous, but there are potentially serious side effects to suppressing blood vessels. One might, for example, damage healthy tissue and organs. Nagy works on suppressing only the blood vessels that feed tumours by concentrating a drug around a tumour.This is just one example of Nagy’s work using genome-modification techniques and stem cell-based approaches. A pioneer in stem cell research, he developed the first two Canadian human embryonic stem cell lines, which are now freely available to Canadian and international researchers. These lines opened up a new era of research. Today, using state-of-the-art genetics to create models for human disease, Nagy is at the forefront of stem cell-based therapies for diseases that are currently incurable. "

Perhaps the most dramatic is amnesia, as when characters from soap operas wake up not knowing who they are. Less dramatic—and more common—is the memory loss associated with aging. In fact, one in four Canadians over the age of 65 has some form of progressive cognitive impairment resulting in memory loss. This has caught the interest of Jennifer Ryan, Canada Research Chair in the Cognitive Neuroscience of Memory. Ryan studies memory, in particular amnesia and what happens to memory as we age.Different regions of the brain work together to support different kinds of memory. For instance, one region is responsible for taking in information about faces or objects and associating them with names; another helps us remember how to perform motor tasks, like riding a bike. Ryan wants to see how different neural systems cooperate to support memory—and how they break down when there is cognitive impairment.To carry out her research, Ryan uses eye-movement monitoring, a technique taken from psychology, and magnetoencephalography (MEG), an imaging technique that measures the magnetic fields produced by electrical activity in the brain. She is the first to combine these methods, and believes that doing so offers a distinct advantage. Eye-movement monitoring, based on the idea that a subject’s eyes are attracted to areas of the environment that have changed, helps Ryan understand what a subject remembers. MEG allows her to look at which regions of the brain are “on” while this is happening. The result is an association between different kinds of memory and certain areas of the brain.For Ryan, understanding how memory systems break down is a way to understand how memory is organized more generally. She believes her research will eventually help people cope better with some of the memory deficits experienced in aging and amnesia. "

This means they can turn into cell types as diverse as heart cells, blood cells, insulin-producing pancreatic cells and liver cells, and are in high demand to help regenerate tissues and organs damaged by various chronic diseases and conditions, such as Parkinson’s disease, spinal cord injury, heart disease, leukemia, and diabetes. Stem cells and their use in regenerative medicine are the focus of work being carried out by Canada Research Chair Gordon Keller. Keller studies the cues that direct embryonic stem cells to make different cell types. The knowledge he gains will form the basis for developing the specific cells needed to replace or regenerate cells that have been damaged through disease, accidents, or age.

Working at the nexus of computer science and biology, he develops and uses algorithms that will help make individualized treatments a reality by making sense of the deluge of information being gleaned from cancer-related experiments.The abundance of data comes, in part, from investigating the involvement of the relevant genes and their protein products in the biological processes related to cancer. In order to analyze the multitude of parameters and their combinations, scientists devise complex experiments in which many steps can be carried out by computers and the myriad computational algorithms (sequences of machine instructions) used to process the information.This is where Jurisica’s work in integrative computational biology comes in. By applying his computational algorithms to the results of these experiments, Jurisica is learning about cancer at the molecular level and integrating it with disease progression and outcome. The result? Invaluable insights into how tumours are generated, how treatments can be matched to a patient's genetic profile, and how scientists can read molecular signatures so as to detect cancer at a much earlier state, even before symptoms appear.Jurisica's work is critically important, aimed at enabling health professionals to target a single patient with individualized treatment, an approach that is guaranteed to have greater success than treating all patients the same.

In 2000, it was estimated that 171 million people suffered from this condition, and that by 2030, this number would increase to more than 360 million. What makes it worse is that the people who have it often develop other devastating long-term complications as well, such as amputation, blindness, kidney failure and stroke. So how can we prevent it in the first place?That’s what Canada Research Chair Anthony Hanley wants to find out. He works at identifying the factors that promote the onset of diabetes in high-risk populations, such as Aboriginal Canadians. Also under scrutiny are those high-risk people who develop metabolic syndrome—a clustering of risk factors for both diabetes and heart disease—and gestational diabetes, which occurs during pregnancy but usually resolves following the birth. Hanley studies the progression of these metabolic disorders, which provide a window to study early stages in the natural history of diabetes. In addition, he is examining the lifestyle (including nutritional) and metabolic factors that are related to the progression of insulin resistance and pancreatic beta cell dysfunction. Insulin resistance prevents the body from being able to use its own insulin adequately; beta cell dysfunction refers to the inability of insulin-producing cells to keep up with demand. Together, these are the most important conditions leading to Type 2 diabetes, and if we are to prevent the onset of this disease, we must understand what causes them both.Hanley’s research represents a significant step in supporting population-based intervention strategies as well as policy development designed for chronic disease prevention in vulnerable populations.

Unfortunately, research on the long-term consequences of bullying supports this connection—bullying is consistently associated with current and future physical and mental health problems, as well as academic difficulties. Studies show that about 30 per cent of children are bullied by their peers. For 10 per cent of these children, the abuse they endure occurs on a daily basis. These statistics highlight the urgent need to reduce bullying in Canadian schools. Dr. Tracy Vaillancourt, Canada Research Chair in Children’s Mental Health and Violence Prevention, is examining the biological underpinnings of bullying. She aims to better understand why bullying hurts so much, and why, for many, the hurt persists into adulthood—long after the abuse has ended.

It turns out that the most important part of the training is the brain learning how to control the body in complex situations. This central question still drives Munoz’s research today. Munoz is now a world leader in understanding how the brain controls a specific type of eye movement called a saccade. A saccade is the eye movement we make when glancing from one object of interest to another. We make almost 200,000 of these movements every day. Researchers now know that saccades are controlled through complex pathways in the brain. Munoz studies how these pathways provide precise voluntary control of saccadic eye movements. His lab combines eye tracking with neurophysiology and neuroimaging to study sensory, motor, and cognitive control of saccades.

Turbulence is a common part of air travel. It can sometimes be a little scary—and on the rare occasion, even deadly. So why can’t pilots just avoid it? In good part, that’s because nobody really understands it. Turbulence is one of the greatest unsolved problems in classical physics—and cracking the enigma would do a lot more than give travelers a smoother trip. Turbulence also influences aircraft drag (and thus fuel consumption), blood flow in humans, the flow of fuel in cars and planes, and the dispersion of pollution in the air. Yet no theory has been developed to fully account for its effects. As Canada Research Chair in Turbulence Simulations and Modelling, Dr. Ugo Piomelli is hoping to explain and predict this phenomenon using computers to model complex turbulent flows. This work requires heavyweight computing power—clusters of thousands of interconnected computers that solve complex equations using advanced numerical techniques. Piomelli and his research team are working to refine these techniques, building new models to save time and resources and predict turbulent flows more accurately. This could lead to better vehicle design and efficiency, more effective artificial heart valves, and more accurate weather forecasts, among a range of other potentially significant improvements.

Among caucasians, cystic fibrosis is the most prevalent, lethal genetic disease, afflicting at least 30,000 people in North America. Dr. Gergely Lukacs believes that if we understood the disease better at the cellular and molecular level, we could design more efficient therapies. As Canada Research Chair in Molecular Cell Biology of Cystic Fibrosis and Other Conformational Diseases, he is exploring how mutations in the cystic fibrosis gene cause molecular, cellular and organ malfunctions. Cystic fibrosis is caused by the mutation of a particular gene that helps create sweat, digestive juices, and mucus. Normally, this mutated gene creates a protein that anchors itself to to the outer membrane, or skin, of cells in the sweat glands, lungs, pancreas and other organs. That protein works like a channel, connecting the inner part of the cell to the surrounding fluid and allowing chloride to move into the cell. When the gene mutates, however, the chloride gets trapped outside the cell, where it begins to attract sodium, creating excess salt.Lukacs’s research has shown that mutations keep this channel from being built, while a small molecular tag called ""ubiquitin"" appears to speed up the junking of material brought up to the cell surface through the channel. Lukacs uses innovative biochemical, biophysical and morphological approaches to work out exactly what these mutations do to a cell and to the channel.

All of these functions depend on what are know as eukaryotic steroid hormones. Only a few tissues are able to make these steroid hormones from cholesterol. Dr. Vassilios Papadopoulos wants to understand how the adrenal glands, gonads and brain make these steroids, and he wants a clearer picture of the role they play in health and disease. As Canada Research Chair in Biochemical Pharmacology, Papadopoulos wants to see how cholesterol gets into mitochondria (the cell’s powerhouse) and how it influences the rate at which steroids form and the way that mitochondrial membranes form. Changes in these functions could cause disease in tissues that affect the entire body.With this information in hand, we can develop new tools to treat diseases caused by steroid levels that are too high or too low. We might even find ways to manipulate the body’s steroids to stop diseases before they start or before they get too far along. This research will have a direct impact on our understanding of reproduction and development, stress-related disorders, aging and brain-related dysfunction, and cancer. "

However, public opinion polls show that there is still opposition to the integration of minority groups, and as a result the country is being deprived of their contribution—which would be significant, not only culturally and intellectually, but also economically.Until now, research on social inclusion has focused more on ways to overcome obstacles that prevent disadvantaged groups from gaining access to training and employment. As Canada Research Chair in Intergroup Relations, Ann Beaton plans to concentrate instead on the reactions of three groups to social exclusion: women working in non-traditional occupations, Aboriginal youth achieving academic success, and persons with disabilities trying to make a place for themselves in the labour market. The way members of disadvantaged groups choose to react to being excluded influences the development of diversified, inclusive work or educational environments. Beaton’s program will enable her to document the repercussions of a broad range of reactions to the perception of discrimination, and to examine the role of individual and social factors in the choice of one type of reaction instead of another. She will be conducting her research in close collaboration with professionals and representatives from a variety of community organizations, and it will generate benefits for social practices and public policy. For example, the research on women will help the members of a number of coalitions to set up effective programs to enhance women’s contribution and leadership in engineering, science, technology and trades throughout Canada and abroad.

To this end, Dr. Audrey Moores, Canada Research Chair in Green Chemistry, is working on microscopically small particles called metal nanoparticles. In some chemical reactions, these nanoparticles are like catalysts, meaning they make reactions more likely, decrease the energy input necessary for the reaction, and reduce the waste that is generated. Moores is designing new catalysts by modifying the surface of the nanoparticles, where the catalyzed chemical reactions happen. She is also designing complex materials. For example, she is putting nanoparticles in solvents or other materials, like silica. This way, several reactions can happen at the same time in the same vessel, which is very important, since it means the chemist can cut out some expensive steps.Moore’s work may give us, to paraphrase the old DuPont slogan, greener living through chemistry.

In fact, depression is a major public health issue for childbearing women around the world. Unfortunately, depression during this time period often remains undiagnosed and untreated.As the Canada Research Chair in Perinatal Community Health, Dr. Cindy-Lee Dennis, appointed at U of T’s Lawrence S. Bloomberg Faculty of Nursing, aims to improve the provision of care to women in the perinatal period (that is, from pregnancy to the first year post-partum). Her research focuses on post-partum depression, a condition with, often, disabling symptoms such as sadness, insomnia, confusion, anxiety, guilt and suicidal feelings. Low self-esteem, an inability to cope, and feelings of incompetence and loneliness frequently exacerbate those symptoms.Dennis’s research has found that health professionals can play a significant role in detecting and managing depression among pregnant women and new mothers. She and her team have identified a variety of barriers that keep mothers from seeking help, including the inability to identify signs of depression, the fear of stigmatization, and simply not knowing where help can be found. There are also cultural differences that complicate detecting and treating this condition, such as traditional post-partum rituals and even culturally-unique depressive symptoms. These differences can present problems in identifying depression in non-Western populations if Western-developed tools (which rely on self-reporting of feelings and emotions) are used. Because of Canada’s increasing immigrant population, and because recent research suggests immigrant mothers are significantly more likely to develop depression than Canadian-born mothers, it is vital to understand this cultural component in order to adequately detect depression among this population. Dennis’s multidisciplinary research program is also looking at innovative approaches to preventing and treating depression during the perinatal period. She is the principal investigator of two major research projects. The first is evaluating the effectiveness of mother-to-mother support in preventing post-partum depression among high-risk women. The second, involving more than 25 health regions across Canada, is evaluating the effect of telephone-based psychotherapy in treating post-partum depression among women in rural and remote areas. Both trials will include complete economic evaluations and, if they are found to be effective, will offer planners virtually all of the information required to implement these techniques in their own jurisdictions.

After reunification in 1975, these groups were treated with great suspicion, but the church has remained strong, with more than five million Vietnamese calling themselves Catholic today.Despite this intertwined history, there is a lack of scholarship on the role of the Catholic Church in Vietnam, and with it, a lack of understanding of how Catholicism shaped the country’s culture and beliefs, even though so many of Canada’s immigrants have been Vietnamese. As the Canada Research Chair in Southeast Asian History, Dr. Nhung Tuyet Tran is documenting this history.Tran combines her knowledge of the region with her research focus—the intersection of gender, law and religious practice—to explore the social and cultural history of Vietnamese Catholicism, with a strong focus on the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, when Catholicism put down strong roots that would develop into the widespread worship seen today. Specifically, Tran seeks to explain why Vietnamese people converted to Catholicism and how they experienced the religion. She’ll also examine why the early converts were overwhelmingly female. Finding these answers is particularly challenging because past research connected Catholicism to the formal imposition of French colonial power in the area, but Tran will look beyond these colonialist and nationalist narratives. Through this study, the first of its kind, Tran will shed new light not just on this faith, but on the broader role of faith in colonial and post-colonial societies world-wide, while adding to our knowledge of the history of an important Canadian immigrant group.

With this disease, the heart muscle becomes inflamed and weak, unable to pump normally. Eventually, it can no longer circulate enough blood to sustain life.We need to better understand this disease in order to treat it and, since most cases are preventable, to recommend better ways to stop heart failure from happening in the first place. Gramolini is working to understand the disease on a fundamental level, examining the molecular events involved in the disease’s development.At present, we know little about this, but we do know that several cellular pathways are involved in heart failure, and these pathways all involve calcium in the cells of our heart. Calcium is vital. It allows muscles to contract. But in the wrong combination or at the wrong time, it can have many ill effects. Gramolini will investigate calcium-binding protein networks that are affected during heart failure, looking for specific interactions that may be key steps in this disease’s progression. While some risk factors for heart disease—smoking, lack of exercise and poor diet—are well known (and should be avoided) the disease also strikes healthy people, sometimes in the prime of their lives. After onset, it can develop rapidly, claiming the life of a previously healthy person in just a few years. By better understanding the disease, Gramolini will give these people hope, while hopefully giving the rest of us more targeted and clear prevention methods, as well as better diagnostic measures to ensure any problems can be caught early and stopped.

We do this quickly, and unconsciously. If we had to put this process down in a flowchart, it would take pages just to sketch out. There are dozens, often hundreds, of questions to answers and rules to invent when solving even our simplest problems.Dr. Brendan Frey has a problem of his own.

In most cases, though, it is still unclear how gene expression will really play out in nature, or in organisms not normally studied in the lab. How do changes in the environment, mating and social behaviour affect gene expression and, as a result, the traits of organisms in the wild? Dr. Maydianne Andrade, Canada Research Chair in Integrative Behavioural Ecology, is examining variation in gene expression in three species of spiders. Building on her past work on cannibalistic black widow spiders, she plans to test a new theory about how the frequency and conditions of mating shape the evolution of what researchers call “plasticity.” Plasticity—or variability in gene expression in response to environmental cues—may be more likely in species like the Australian redback spider, because males need to survive and mate under a narrow range of variable conditions shortly after they hit adulthood. On the other hand, more long-lived species, like the Western black widow, mate more than once and are unlikely to change their development in response to short-term changes in their local environment. The emerging field of integrative behavioural ecology looks to interpret animal behaviour as a function of social, sexual and genetic processes. Andrade’s work in this field is filling a much-needed gap, since it unfolds both in the lab and in the wild. Most studies of this kind have not been conducted in natural habitats, so our understanding of the links between environmental and social factors and physiological and genetic processes has so far been limited. Andrade’s work will not only help us better understand the threat posed by the specific populations she studies (the black widow’s venom is toxic to humans, and plasticity may increase their invasiveness), but will help us understand how natural conditions shape diversity.

That’s 16 per cent of Canada's total output from all sources. These emissions grew by 15 per cent from 1990 to 2003, partly due to growing house sizes and an increased reliance on air conditioning. Given Canada's demographics and increasing wealth, the trends toward larger houses and more comfort are expected to continue, putting more and more of a strain on energy consumption and producing more GHG emissions.Dr. Ian Beausoleil-Morrison will devote part of his time as Canada Research Chair in the Modelling and Simulation of Innovative Energy Systems for Residential Buildings to examining small-scale co-generation of heat and electricity for houses. Based on the same ideas behind fuel cells and combustion engines, these small-scale devices placed inside houses might be able to reduce energy use and GHG emissions, and alleviate demands on already-strained central electricity generation and distribution systems.

The smooth operation of your immune system is so remarkable, it's no wonder it fascinates scientists—but there is one part of it that is especially mysterious and important.Your B-cells operate somewhat like a security force, patrolling your body until they discover a threat, marking it for other cells to destroy, and keeping a record of it so the next time the same threat invades, your body can respond even faster. For B-cells to effectively target invaders, however, these cells (also called B-lymphocytes) must evolve in just a few days. This fast evolution requires their DNA to mutate, and that is very unusual—in fact, our body has several mechanisms to stop DNA form mutating. So what's happening?We're normally protected from DNA mutation by DNA repair pathways, which preserve our vital genetic information, preventing accumulated mutations that can lead to serious diseases like cancer. As Canada Research Chair in Genetic Diversity, Dr Javier Di Noia is studying this process to reveal how it might be used to improve our immune response and to better understand our genes.To mutate, B-lymphocytes use a special mutator enzyme and also co-opt the repair pathways. Di Noia is studying the interplay between this enzyme and the pathways, trying to understand how the repair pathways are carefully subverted in B-cells to allow mutation of the genes that produce helpful antibodies, but not of others.Failures in this mechanism produce immunodeficiency (increased susceptibility to infections), while its exacerbated (or “deregulated”) functioning leads to widespread mutations that predispose a person to B-cell lymphomas—cancerous tumours in the lymph nodes. Aside from helping develop possible treatments for these diseases, Di Noia's research is also vital in light of new superbugs that can resist most antibiotics. His work also has enormous potential for immunotherapy, which could someday let us supercharge our natural defence systems to help fight even the most serious illnesses. "

Traditionally, the freezing temperatures that are miserably uncomfortable for people have also proven to be deadly to one of the forest’s most deadly threats: the mountain pine beetle. However, as the world’s climate changes, winters in the boreal forest have been getting warmer and dryer, promoting the survival and eastward spread of the beetle. If the mountain pine beetle continues to kill pine trees in its move eastward across Canada’s boreal forest, its spread will have serious ecological, social and cultural consequences. The boreal forest has been noted as a critical part of Earth’s life support system. Covering about 1.4 billion acres of intact forest and wetlands, the forest stores about 186 billion tonnes of carbon taken from the air. Losing the boreal forest would significantly affect the amount of greenhouse gasses in the air, and could lead to greater global warming.

The same can happen in the vessels that carry blood through our bodies: too slow a flow and sediment builds up. In fact, our blood vessels require a balance every bit as delicate as that of a river. While too slow a flow is no good, neither is too fast—in a river, it floods the banks; in our body, it puts too much pressure on the blood vessel walls.As Canada Research Chair in Cardiovascular Physiology, Dr. Stephanie Lehoux studies this delicate balance, focusing on the endothelial cells that line the walls of our arteries. These cells thrive when there is high sheer stress, but not when the flow is low, or irregular. The latter causes something called “endothelial activation,” which favours all sorts of build-ups in the blood vessels.But high blood pressure causes problems, too. Called ""arterial hypertension,"" this pressure can cause vessels to become rigid, and can damage organs. Both high and low blood pressure contribute to the cardiovascular diseases that are the leading cause of death in developed countries.By working to understand the molecular basis of cardiovascular disease, Lehoux will develop an underlying knowledge of these serious conditions. This knowledge will allow us to use current drugs much more effectively, and identify new molecules that can be targeted by the next generation of life-extending cardiovascular drugs. "

Poinar hasn't built a time machine to the future, though; he's built a million-dollar lab that offers a window into the past. And he’s using the information he gathers to help inform the present—and the future.With new technologies and methods increasing our ability to extract and interpret DNA sequence information covering a stretch of history in a particular area, Poinar is able to push back the clock and recover genetic sequences from samples up to several million years old, from diverse climates and conditions throughout the world. Poinar’s research focuses on designing and applying new extraction and repair strategies for ancient DNA buried within fossil samples. The DNA is then amplified and sequenced. From this, Poinar can gather genetic information to place the DNA/RNA sequences into evolutionary frameworks to answer particular questions.For example, work in Poinar’s laboratory with the oldest known HIV-1 samples from 1959 Africa is aimed towards answering two outstanding sets of research questions. First, when did HIV-1 make the jump to humans, and what was the source of the transfer? Second, will having a more complete understanding, by looking at direct ancestral HIV/SIV sequences, of the pace of the evolution and how it developed, help researchers create better HIV vaccines?Poinar’s work will lead to better understanding of the evolution of pandemic infections, thereby helping researchers track the spread of future infectious disease. It will also have major impacts on the recovery of DNA from forensic, archaeological and fossil samples, letting us look into the past and watch evolution in real time. "

Studying the Secrets of Your Mind’s Ability to Focus You’re driving down the road, paying attention to the cars around you when, suddenly, a thought enters your mind—it could be something from the workday, dinner plans or an idea for the distant future. Whatever the case, a few moments later you realize you’ve become so absorbed that you haven’t been paying attention to the road. Why was your mind completely focused on one thing one moment, and on something else the next?In fact, what we pay attention to and what we do helps define us—sometimes in good ways, such as when we are able to focus on a tough task while surrounded by distractions, and other times in ways that frustrate us, as when we want to attend to one thing but find our minds distracted by another.As Canada Research Chair in the Cognitive Neuroscience of Attention, Dr. Amir Raz studies how we pay attention and, specifically, what goes on inside our brains the moment we successfully focus our attention on one thing or, alternatively, fail to achieve that focus. It’s a topic Raz knows about in more ways than one, having used the power of attention many times to fool his audiences during his former career as a magician.In his research, Raz uses novel types of attention—including the extreme conditions of hypnosis and sleep deprivation—to understand how the process works. He also looks for ways to understand important human achievements through the lens of attention, helping us better understand these successes. A highly successful mediator, for instance, is someone who can quickly get people who are very angry at each other, to focus on something else entirely, thereby regulating their actions and emotions.By using modern brain-imaging tools, Raz will deepen our understanding of attention, one of the oldest and most important issues in psychological science, and an essential part of almost every other mental process. In time, such research will lead to innovations in education, new treatments for pathological conditions, and new ways to approach rehabilitation and cognitive training. It is difficult to achieve anything at all—let alone anything great—without being focused. By helping us understand how and why we pay attention to certain things, Raz’s research will show us new ways to focus on the things that matter most to us. "

Muscle exertion and gravity are essential to the normal development of bone tissue. Too much exertion, however, causes growth anomalies or disorders of the muscular and bone tissue. And orthopaedic treatments for these problems can have considerable physical and psychological effects on young patients (including, in particular, a disease called idiopathic scoliosis), and involve major costs for society. As Canada Research Chair in Mechanobiology of the Pediatric Musculoskeletal System, Dr. Isabelle Villemure is mainly seeking to find out how growing bone tissue responds to its mechanical environment. She is taking a multi-disciplinary approach to her research, working in collaboration with orthopaedic surgeons, cellular and molecular biologists, and engineering colleagues.Equally central to the researcher’s work is enhancing the quality of life of young patients, which she hopes to do by improving current treatments and developing orthopaedic approaches. Until now, no study has been able to explain the biological mechanisms by which muscular exertion and gravity change the growth of bone tissue. According to Villemure, we need to understand these mechanisms in depth if we want young patients to be able to benefit from the treatments provided to them.Villemure’s research will make it possible to develop treatments based on the mechanical regulation process, particularly through minimally invasive approaches (such as using clips). In addition, Villemure plans to use insights gained from this research in further work on tissue engineering. "

You rummage and eventually find the package that contained some of the food you prepared last night. You check the label and breathe a sign of relief—it wasn’t the brand they mentioned on the newscast, the one recalled because it had made many seriously ill.Stories like these are common, even in an highly developed country like Canada—contaminated food makes many Canadians ill each year, and can destroy the livelihood of a farmer or restaurant owner who, despite his or her best efforts, delivers or serves contaminated food. As Canada Research Chair in Microbes, the Environment and Food Safety, Dr. Christopher K. Yost will work to prevent food contamination, focusing on two promising ways to enhance Canadian food safety.One way food gets contaminated is through irrigation of crops with dirty water—water contaminated by fecal material loaded with potentially lethal microbial pathogens. But where did that contamination start? This question can be answered by microbial source tracking (MST). Yost will work develop better bio-indicators to improve the accuracy of MST, thereby helping policy-makers and food producers design better strategies to protect watersheds from contamination.But food can also be contaminated after harvest. Each year, millions of dollars of food gets contaminated this way and, ultimately, destroyed. To prevent this, Yost is studying and working to perfect biopreservation, which preserves food by injecting it with lactic acid bacteria, a safe bacteria that competes with the bad bacteria that cause contamination and spoilage. This approach, while promising, still has many kinks to be ironed out. For example, researchers still need to determine which strains of good bacteria can best combat the bad types, and for how long.These natural approaches to food safety will satisfy consumers who are becoming increasingly suspicious of artificial preservatives, while also providing new tools to protect food safety. The results could save millions of dollars for Canada’s agricultural sector by ensuring that a greater proportion of the food that farmers produce can safely make it to market. "

The Mi’kmaq have entered an intensified period of institution building with far-reaching economic, political and cultural consequences for community sustainability. The empowerment of Mi’kmaq communities is imperative for the creation of negotiated settlements that are in the best interests of the cultural health of the communities. This empowerment will also remedy negative colonial relations that have plagued developments in these vital areas.

They charge to the scene of an infection and put a stop to it.Like a firefighter, they first receive an alarm signal and then get themselves ready for the call—going through a series of steps to attach themselves to the nearest blood vessel. Then they ride that vessel to the area that needs their help.But sometimes the whole process goes wrong. The white blood cells do the equivalent of hosing down a house that isn’t actually on fire. In medical terms, the result of this overreaction can be inflammation with no apparent cause. This sort of inflammation is common is many diseases, including arthritis, asthma, sepsis and organ-transplant rejection.Unfortunately, researchers have not found a way to stop these white cells from consistently overreacting to false alarms. The cells should just turn around and wait for the next call, but, instead, they stay, turning relatively minor problems into chronic ailments.As Canada Research Chair in Leukocyte Recruitment in Inflammatory Disease, Dr. Paul Kubes has spent years understanding the underlying causes of these chronic ailments. More than a decade ago, he discovered that nitric oxide played some sort of intermediary role in determining how the white cells responded to alarms. But what role exactly it played, and how it did so, remained a mystery for a few more years, until Kubes discovered that fact as well. Armed with this knowledge, Kubes and his research team are trying to figure out how best to use nitric oxide to control the damaging impacts of these inflammatory diseases.Just as you don’t call a fire department directly, so too cells go through a series of steps to relay a message from the site of the problem, using chemical signals rather than telephone lines. By understanding those signals and seeing how nitric oxide might be able to alter them, Kubes hopes to figure out ways to make sure that false-alarm messages get heard loud and clear. Ultimately, he hopes to understand the entire communication process from start to finish. Not only will this help treat the millions of Canadians who suffer from these chronic problems, it will also shed new light on the very language our cells use to keep our bodies functioning. "

Using the power of genomics and informatics, as well as animal models, Goldowitz is studying the normal and abnormal development of the brain. His multi-disciplinary approach will identify the genetic architecture of brain development and function, and will allow scientists to devise new therapeutic treatments for disorders and diseases that exact a significant toll on the afflicted child, the caring family and the society that provides support to those in medical need.

First, he will examine the amount of time patients spend waiting for a specialist consultation after a family physician referral—an area in which there is a surprising lack of Canadian data. Next, he will work on several projects investigating what determines access to health care for vulnerable groups, such as women and children, in developing countries. Given Statistics Canada’s recent prediction that by 2030 population increases in Canada will be driven entirely by immigration, understanding what determines health services use in immigrants’ home countries may provide us with clues to how they use these services in Canada. Finally, Thind will use longitudinal cohort data from the US to develop models that examine outcomes for low-income women receiving breast cancer treatment. Overall, Thind’s work as Canada Research Chair in Health Services Research will contribute to a better understanding of the causes of wait times for health services in Canada, and help policy-makers improve access to services in an era of resource constraints.

Using an optical fibre less than one hundredth of an inch across, Yang can image the blood flow in capillaries newly created by cancer cells or watch the movement of one single red blood cell at a time. “The dream is to be able to do this not only in research labs, but also in the operating room for individual patients,” says Yang, who is an engineer, a physicist and medical doctor.Cancerous tissues form new and abnormal blood vessels, which are different from normal tissue. By applying optical fibre and laser technology from the telecommunication industry, Yang’s research team at Ryerson University is developing new techniques for imaging normal and cancerous tissues by observing this microvasculature. When light is reflected off moving red blood cells, its colour changes ever so slightly—a shift that can then be detected by the imaging devices built in Yang’s lab. “Just like how police officers detect your car’s speed using radar,” explains Yang, “except a typical car moves more than one million times faster than the red blood cell, and the patient’s own breathing motion can be 10 times faster than the blood flow.” Yang hopes his research and collaborative work with the University Health Network, St. Michael’s Hospital, and Sunnybrook Health Science Centre will not only make it possible to image cancer vasculature, but will also guide treatment to kill these abnormal vessels.

As a scientist in McMaster University’s Stem Cell and Cancer Research Institute, Singh now spends her life looking for the molecular and genetic answers to these questions.She’s discovered an abnormal stem cell—the brain tumour initiating cell (BTIC)—that may drive the formation of brain tumours. It’s the first isolation of cancer stem cells in the central nervous system—a discovery with important implications for understanding how brain tumours start. Most important to Singh’s research is the idea that only a small population of cancer stem cells, and not every cell in a brain tumour, is capable of generating and propagating. Current approaches to brain tumours focus on every cell in the tumour rather than on the rare tumour stem cell, and this may explain the poor response of brain tumours to current treatments. Future therapies that target the BTIC could better halt the growth and propagation of tumours. Singh and her team will continue to search for better surface markers for the BTIC, making it possible to isolate the cell even more specifically and easily. Her work will offer insight into patient prognosis, as patients with a higher proportion of BTICs may have a shorter survival and worse prognosis.

His research on how protective clothing, heat stress and exercise performance interact will offer real evidence to back up the adage. Emergency workers such as firefighters and hazardous waste disposal workers obviously face extreme occupational heat stress. They have to perform physically demanding jobs while wearing heavy, cumbersome protective gear. And, of course, they need to stay mentally alert while doing so. Body temperatures can rise due to a hot environment or physical activity, or a combination of the two. Either way, having our body temperature stay greatly above normal for an extended period (a condition called hyperthermia) can harm several of our bodies’ systems, affecting, for example, our nerves' and muscle tissues' response, the blood flow to our brains, and cognitive function, or our ability to think. Cheung’s preliminary research has already shown that cooling the head and neck, even while maintaining core hyperthermia in the body, can significantly moderate the body’s reaction to heat stress. His investigations will now compare how this localized cooling affects peoples’ physical and mental responses to changes in their core temperature.Specifically, Cheung’s research will look at how manipulating what is termed “regional temperature” in this way stacks up against manipulating central temperature in how they affect core body temperature. He will also take a close look at the relative importance of physical and mental responses to regional cooling.Cheung’s research results will ultimately help in the design and development of enhanced technology, training and occupational safety for those people who risk their lives to protect the rest of us.

Krishnan measures frequency and intensity, too, but in a far more exact and specialized way. Take an arthritic knee: when bent, it emits a sound that can be measured by highly precise instruments that pay attention to the high and low points of the sound's frequency, as well as the intervals between that sound and the next.Different sorts of injuries produce different types of time-frequency patterns, and with the right instruments and the right base of knowledge, a doctor might be able to diagnose the location of a knee problem without using expensive and invasive arthroscopy, a procedure where a fibre-optic probe inspects the cartilage surface.By experimenting with this method and refining related technology and procedures, Krishnan will pioneer new ways to diagnose a variety of illnesses and plan their treatment.

But a BSE or “mad cow” outbreak also devastates livelihoods and industries: farmers must kill entire herds, after which export markets remain closed to them for years or even decades. Perhaps most troubling is recent evidence suggesting the disease might not only be transmitted from animal to animal, but could also emerge spontaneously in livestock. As Canada Research Chair in Prion Diseases, Dr. David Westaway is working to uncover the causes of BSE and other prion diseases, with particular attention to new “sporadic” cases. Prions are infectious agents that cause fatal brain diseases. They are very different from bacteria, viruses and other commonly known causes of infection as they contain only a single molecule—a misfolded protein. Prion diseases are poorly understood; sporadic prion diseases present an even greater challenge, because they can emerge in clean livestock, and may be associated with novel variants that are not only more difficult to combat, but more likely to spread to new species, perhaps including humans.

Although smoking is a contributing risk factor for the disease, COPD can also be caused by air pollution, occupational dust exposure and certain genetic conditions. The disease makes it hard for lungs to take in air. As COPD progresses, shortness of breath becomes increasingly pronounced, until daily physical activities—from climbing stairs to simply getting up from a chair—become almost impossible. Left untreated, COPD is deadly. Dr. Dina Brooks, Canada Research Chair in Rehabilitation for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, is seeking new ways to stop, or even reverse, the progression of COPD. By exploring more effective treatment and rehabilitation plans—from improving physical activity prescriptions for COPD sufferers, to evaluating rehabilitation technologies like wheeled walkers and home oxygen use, to establishing better long-term strategies—Dr. Brooks aims to bring hope to sufferers of this chronic lung disease by ensuring lasting benefits from rehabilitation and helping them maintain quality of life. Through her work, Dr. Brooks will cut down on costly and resource-intensive COPD hospitalizations and provide specialized training for researchers and practitioners in the healthcare system. Above all, by providing better treatment protocols for COPD symptoms like shortness of breath, Dr. Brooks’ research will make daily life much more manageable for sufferers of the disease. "

Over a third involve patients under 65. Although joint replacements are very effective at eliminating pain and restoring joint function, current implants do not last indefinitely, because of factors such as implant wear and corrosion. These factors can lead to adverse biological reactions—including bone loss around the implant. As a result, many younger patients will outlive their implants, and will eventually need replacements. Further, patients who suffer from other types of conditions involving bone loss—such as bone cancer or specific bone fractures that do not heal—often need bone substitutes to repair their bone defects. Dr. Isabelle Catelas, Canada Research Chair in Bioengineering in Orthopaedics, wants to increase the longevity of joint—particularly hip—implants, by analyzing the causes for failures and developing approaches that will regulate the biological mechanisms leading to these failures. She is also working on the development of new bone substitutes that mimic natural bone. To accomplish these goals, Catelas is taking a multifaceted approach, bringing together concepts from a range of disciplines—such as materials science and nanotechnologies, cell and molecular biology, and medicine. Catelas’s research will improve our understanding of why and how joint implants fail, and will lead to longer-lasting implants. Her research will also lead to the development of enhanced bone regeneration approaches that will give patients additional and improved options for battling bone loss. Catelas’s research will be an important step forward for the increasing number of people who need joint replacements or have to deal with bone loss as our population lives longer. "

In addition, it brings with it a vast arsenal of cells, including ones that produce antibodies to protect us against disease. Blood is composed of a number of types of specialized cells, and these cells needs to be replenished constantly. It is the job of hematopoietic stem cells to replenish our blood reserves.Hematopoiesis encompasses all the processes leading to the formation of all the cells that make up blood. The goal of Dr. Tarik Möröy, Canada Research Chair in Immune Cell Hematopoiesis and Differentiation, is to shed light on these complex mechanisms. The research group directed by Möröy at the Institut de recherches cliniques de Montréal (IRCM) is working on decoding the altered genetic program of hematopoietic cells. The goal is to determine the factors that cause abnormal growth and development within these cells, which, in turn, can cause blood cancers such as lymphoma and leukemia, and may also have an effect on the workings of the immune system.

These images give doctors critical information about damaged body parts or diseased organs without exposing the patient to potentially harmful radiation.Despite MRI’s advantages, it suffers from a big problem: it takes a long time to acquire the data to create these high-resolution images. An MRI exam can take over an hour. This may not sound like much until you consider that while the scan is going on the patient must lie perfectly still in a long narrow tube while the MRI makes noise as loud as a rock concert. Dr. Charles McKenzie, Canada Research Chair in Parallel Magnetic Resonance Imaging, is working to break the speed limits of MRI using a technique called Parallel MRI. In a standard MRI scan an image is built up one piece at a time, similar to the way a fax machine scans a document one line at a time. In parallel MRI, large numbers of sensors are used to acquire many parts of the image at the same time, dramatically reducing scan time. McKenzie is developing technologies for Parallel MRI that may ultimately allow all the sections of an MRI image to be acquired simultaneously. This would open a huge array of possibilities, including taking an MRI of the entire body in just a few seconds or getting an image of the heart within a single heart beat. "

To do this, she will consult many sources, including Canadian studies conducted in 1998, 2003 and 2008, on the reporting of cases of child abuse and neglect, police investigations and data concerning Canadian pediatric hospitals. Next, Collin-Vézina will compare these procedures with those followed in other countries, including the United States and France.Drawing on her experience as a mental health clinician and researcher, Collin-Vézina will document the traumatic conditions and symptoms that follow incidents of sexual abuse, as well as the psychosocial factors associated with their expression.Collin-Vézina will also study how symptoms of sexual abuse change over the years, as well as the implementation and evaluation of treatments (for traumatic conditions and symptoms) that are recognized for their effectiveness. In addition, making use of English- and French-language websites about Canada’s health and social services system, Collin-Vézina will undertake longitudinal clinical studies of young people in all age groups, as well as of aboriginal populations.

Right now, 31 per cent of all Canadians are affected by some form of pain. Dr. Diane Gromala suffers from chronic pain herself and, as Canada Research Chair in Computational Technologies for Transforming Pain, will devote much of her research to understanding how virtual reality goggles and headsets relieve feelings of pain. She is also working on building better computerized aids to help patients through biofeedback meditation and visualization therapy. Her goal is to explore new ways to use computer technologies to help people improve their own health outcomes through education, experience and expressing themselves physically. Pain is universal to human existence. One in five Canadians experiences chronic pain. On average, they wait two to five years before seeing a pain specialist. Try as we might to express the quality or intensity of our pain, even the most empathetic person cannot really know what another person’s pain feels like. Gromala is working together with doctors to develop new computerized biofeedback therapies. The therapies promise sufferers a way to express, visualize and keep track of their pain. In addition, they give people in chronic pain a way to gain some control over their suffering while waiting for treatment by specialists. As Canada’s baby boomers enter old age, pain and pain management looms as a huge public health issue.

As ridiculous as this question might seem, answering it has provided important clues as to how body parts are put together in embryo. Scientists have discovered a special family of genes, called Hox genes, that play a key role in shaping the body’s architecture in the embryos of most, or perhaps even all, animals. These genes determine where various body parts grow in the fetus. In some animals, mutations of these genes can result in an animal growing extra or misplaced body parts. In the fruit fly, for instance, a mutation in one of these genes can lead to a leg, rather than an antenna, growing from the fly’s head. Hox genes can also be implicated in the creation of conditions that result in congenital diseases and cancer. In her research as Canada Research Chair in Molecular Embryology and Genetics, Dr. Marie Kmita is studying how developmental Hox genes contribute to the formation of a body’s architecture, and is focusing on the precise nature of the molecular mechanisms involved in these processes. In particular, Kmita is looking at growth defects that happen when Hox genes are absent. Her research will help us better understand how Hox genes become involved in controlling cell apoptosis (programmed cell death) and cell proliferation. Since many cancers result from cells proliferating when they shouldn’t and not dying when they should, her research could lead to new tools for detecting and treating such cancers. It could also lead to the same for many congenital diseases. "

The polar regions are widely predicted to be the first, and most severely, affected. More scientific research is needed, however, to improve our knowledge and understanding of the challenges of global warming. For example, how are climate, oceanic and atmospheric changes related to different levels of sea ice throughout the Arctic (a relationship that scientists refer to as ocean-sea ice-atmosphere processes). How would changes in this relationship affect marine ecosystems? The answers to questions like these will only come by developing better tools to predict and curb the harmful effects of variability and change in the Arctic climate. As Canada Research Chair in Arctic-System Science at the University of Manitoba, Dr. David Barber is leading research in this area. Through his work, Barber wants to expand scientific knowledge about both the physical and biological processes at work in the ocean-sea ice-atmosphere system. He also hopes to develop innovative modelling tools to predict changes in the system, both in space and over time, and to share his discoveries with key stakeholders, such as the Aboriginal peoples of the Arctic and private sector industry. An expert in how movement and energy, including heat, affects sea-ice processes, Barber uses field observations, advanced geography-related technologies (such as remote sensing, computer modelling and geographic information systems), and mathematical models to uncover connections between the atmosphere, waters and biosphere in Arctic marine systems. His groundbreaking work sheds light on how changes in these systems affect the quality and sustainability of the environment and, in turn, of our quality of life. Through his research, Barber is increasing current field research, enhancing collaborations with other leading Canadian and international scientists, and engaging Aboriginal organizations in collecting, analyzing, and integrating data from locations across the Canadian Arctic. His team's findings will prove invaluable in managing the Arctic and, consequently, our planet. "

The biologist hasn’t gone Hollywood, but he is behind a camera of sorts, capturing the rarely seen process of mitosis, or cell division, in real time.The stars of his films are organelles—minute structures within cells that perform specific functions. He’s interested in two of them in particular—centrosomes and centrioles. They play a role in building the “mitotic spindle”—a sort of cellular machine that separates chromosomes when cells divide. When things go wrong building this cellular machine, problems such as cancer or genetic disorders like Down syndrome can arise. Centrosomes and centrioles are also involved in the formation of cilia and flagella as the cell divides. These are the short hair-like structures that help the cell move and that act as antennae, sensing messages being sent throughout the body. Problems with cilia and flagella can lead to conditions like kidney disease and infertility.Pelletier has developed new, cutting-edge techniques for imaging small areas within cells at an extremely high resolution. Traditional microscopes take static snapshots of dead cells, and scientists must study thousands of images to understand what’s going on in a cell. His techniques allow him to visualize multiple cells in three dimensions over time, creating movies that show the entire cell cycle at a resolution high enough to show the chromosomes being segregated before cell division.Pelletier believes that researchers in his field are poised to make great strides in coming years. His own work could have an impact on our understanding and treatment of a wide range of diseases linked to defects in centrosomes or centrioles—structures that have mystified biologists since they were discovered 100 years ago.

Or why you now know so many people with diabetes? Dr. Susanne Clee’s research is showing that the answers to these questions lie, at least in part, in our DNA. We all know that the current obesity epidemic is fuelled by modern lifestyles that combine increased fat and carbohydrate consumption with reduced physical activity. However, some people are able to resist the effects of this environment, while others readily gain weight. At the same time, diabetes is becoming more and more common—no coincidence, since obesity is a major risk factor for diabetes. Most people who develop Type 2 diabetes are overweight, although many overweight people do not develop diabetes. Clee, Canada Research Chair in the Genetics of Obesity and Diabetes, believes genetic factors might be the key to determining who is vulnerable. For most people, obesity and diabetes aren’t caused by changes in a single “magic bullet” type of gene. Instead, variations in dozens of genes may each lead to a small increase or decrease in risk, which, when taken together, determine our likelihood of developing these conditions. This complexity, however, has made it very difficult to identify the different responsible genes, and so far only a handful have been reliably shown to affect our risk of obesity or diabetes. Clee is working to discover additional genes that increase our susceptibility. By studying various strains of mice with different levels of risk for obesity and diabetes, she will determine some of the key things that make them, and us, susceptible. The results will teach us more about how obesity and diabetes develop, and will point to specific things that may have gone awry in ordinary processes to lead to them. This new knowledge will lead to better diagnostic and targeted therapeutic approaches for reducing the consequences of both obesity and diabetes. "

A supporter of this idea, Dr. Janet Conway believes the huge range of anti-globalization movements active right now may be a sign that existing political theories of justice and democracy are being reinvented. As Canada Research Chair in Social Justice, she is studying today’s social movements to understand the shifts in global social order happening around them. Conway sees the World Social Forum (WSF), an annual meeting of anti-globalization activists, as an example of a transnational public space, where diverse grassroots social actors from around the world navigate political and economic inequalities, colonial histories, and social differences to try to build global solidarity. The WSF brings together social movements that are united in their opposition to neoliberal globalization, providing a forum for women, indigenous peoples and the poor to take part in the global justice movement. The event allows local and global groups from all over the globe to meet, share their struggles and build solidarity.Using a new socio-political tool called “open space” (where participating groups organize themselves and mount activities for one another) to structure its meetings, the WSF has expanded in scope and influence, despite having no centralized organization or decision-making, and without state or institutional sponsorship. Conway will investigate the WSF’s relative success in being egalitarian and postcolonial as it confronts issues of colonial difference, feminism and diversity. Her question is: Can the WSF be used as a template for contemporary social movements looking to build effective and inclusive collaborations? The knowledge gained from studying social transformations at the grassroots level could inform our current political processes and, possibly, present us with options for alternative, more just and peaceful world orders.

One result of the country’s changing face is that Canada’s many stories about community are becoming more and more complex. Dr. Warren Cariou, Canada Research Chair in Narrative, Community and Indigenous Cultures, believes that learning how these stories intertwine, interact and overlap is critical to understanding how written and oral narratives define community identity, and to understanding the role such stories play in ongoing struggles for community rights and cultural equality. Cariou is exploring how narratives are used by different indigenous cultures, and is examining these stories both critically and creatively to develop a new and dynamic way of looking at multicultural identities. In particular, he is working closely with Aboriginal and Métis communities to trace the development and significance of traditional oral and written narratives, while at the same time re-examining general notions of community and belonging in Canada. As Canadian society continues to evolve, it will become ever more important to find effective ways to accommodate different communities within our understanding of a multicultural Canada. By revitalizing previously marginalized stories, and by using creative and critical ways to investigate them and their meanings, Cariou’s work aims to redefine what “Canadian community” can mean in the 21st century.

It has been estimated that, in Canada, family violence accounts for one quarter of the violent crime reported to police. Moreover, national studies have found that some 45 in every 100,000 children are investigated by child protective services each year, and that between seven and eight per cent of men and women have experienced some type of violence in their intimate relationships in the past five years. Family violence takes its toll not only on the people directly involved, but also at the social and community levels. Both child abuse and interpersonal violence have been recognized as important risk factors for developing mental health disorders, addictions and criminal activity, and in perpetuating cycles of family violence. There is also a growing consensus that childhood experiences of family violence have long-term effects on people’s physical health and, ultimately, how long they can expect to live. As Canada Research Chair in Family Violence Prevention and Intervention, Dr. Katreena Scott will examine the real costs of family violence. Specifically, she will study the impact of childhood and adolescent abuse, and try to determine the specific pathways that can lead from early abuse experiences to violence in adulthood. Her research includes unique studies on the policies and practices necessary for effective intervention with fathers who have abused their children; understanding and preventing the development of intimate-partner violence; and identifying best practices in intervention with men who have been abusive toward their intimate partners.

It’s a technology that has put Canada’s wireless industry in the national spotlight. Daneshmand will devote part of her time as Canada Research Chair in Radio Frequency Microsystems for Communication and Sensing to applying radio frequency (RF) and MEMS to mobile and satellite communication and biomedical applications, such as “millimetre-wave” MEMS switches and filters, and wireless MEMS biosensors. She will also use the unique characteristics of MEMS devices to solve some of the current problems with RF devices. For example, Daneshmand will combine the thin and thick film technologies used in creating MEMS to make a low-cost MEMS package (the equally tiny structure around the technology that protects it while letting it do what it’s meant to)—one of the major current needs of the RF MEMS market. She will also look specifically at how RF and MEMS technology can be used to help determine pressure in the brain for patients who suffer from head injuries or brain diseases. Finally, Daneshmand will also see if nano-electromechanical systems (NEMS) technology can be used in biomedical sensing devices, such as pressure sensors and glucose sensors. As part of her research, Daneshmand will collaborate with the University of Alberta’s Biomedical Engineering Department, and, specifically, with its nanotechnology and tissues engineering groups, to get the most out of such potentially barrier-breaking technologies.

Dr. Jean-Francois Couture, Canada Research Chair in Structural Biology and Epigenetics, is working to understand the role of the MLL gene, and why MLL leukemia is so difficult to treat. Leukemia linked to MLL appears in both children and adults, probably due to genetic mutations caused by drug treatments. Couture is examining the MLL protein to understand its shape and how it functions in both diseased and normal states. The protein normally works to control genes that tell body parts when and how to develop.

This is for good reason, as the sense of touch is one of the surest ways by which to understand the world. But as much as we use touch to understand the world around us, it is only recently that this method has become available to scientists working to understand the world inside of us. Dr. Andrew Pelling, Canada Research Chair in Experimental Cell Mechanics, is touching and stretching living cells to see how they react. Cells are constantly subject to mechanical forces that affect our health and well-being—forces that emanate from many places, including the movement of our muscles, organs and blood. However, it remains a mystery how these mechanical forces are sensed and transmitted by cells. To understand this, Pelling is using advanced biophysical techniques, including tiny sensors that act as “fingers” to literally feel cells. Pelling’s goal is to apply the knowledge he gains to improving understanding, detection and treatment of cancer, muscular dystrophy and heart disease. His research will also shed light on the normal functioning of cells, which require a precise balance between biochemistry and mechanical forces to control important processes such as gene regulation, proliferation and movement. By understanding how biological pathways are activated, and how cell behaviour may be controlled, Pelling’s research will move us closer to a promising future where we can control small movements inside our bodies as confidently as we do large movements outside.

Microwave imaging may be just the ticket, but there is work to be done. Microwave imaging is cheaper and its hardware can be easily installed in a doctor’s office. It’s no more dangerous than a cell phone and does not require the expensive shielding that is needed with X-rays.An evolving field, and still in its infancy in Canada with no prototype hardware yet developed to test on patients, Dr. Natalia Nikolova, Canada Research Chair in High-Frequency Electromagnetics, wants to change that. Ideally, she would like to make microwave imaging reliable enough to be developed first for clinical tests, then for commercial applications.In partnership with McMaster’s School of Biomedical Engineering, Nikolova is putting together hardware to test “ on phantoms”—manufactured objects that mimic parts of the human body, such as the breast—and put objects that simulate tumours in the “phantoms” to perform measurements.Nikolova is using a vector network analyzer—a microwave measurement tool that measures 16 signals simultaneously—to develop microwave-imaging technology which will allow for regular, frequent, and harmless screening of the female population at risk.As a preliminary screening tool, the imaging technology could be used to screen all women over 40 years of age, every six months in their family doctor’s office. Then, if the result is positive or suspicious, a woman could then have a mammogram or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) procedure.Microwaves are a non-ionizing form of electromagnetic waves that interact with tissues according to water content. Tumours have a higher water content compared to normal tissues. And just as waves scatter when they hit a ship, tumours back-scatter microwaves. By looking into the back-scatter, Nikolova will be able to tell, more or less, what it scattered from, how big it is, its shape and the parameters.Nikolova says the tool could save additional lives, since studies show some particularly aggressive types of tumours may grow from one millimetre to a dangerous size of one centimetre and a half in less than six months. For these cases especially, the current (mammography) screening every one or two years is inefficient. With breast cancer, the chance of a woman surviving is greater than 95 per cent if the tumour is less than one centimetre in size.Nikolova’s research in microwave-imaging will improve the effectiveness and availability of non-invasive methods for detecting tumours.

Despite breakthroughs in recent years in the areas of prevention and treatment, breast cancer will affect one Canadian woman in nine during her lifetime. A family history of breast cancer has been recognized as one of the main risk factors. Recent discoveries in genomics suggest that most of the family risk of cancer is the result of different types of genetic variation. For example, mutations in the two main genes that predispose breast cancer, BRCA1 and BRCA2, cause around 15 to 20 per cent of cancers found in members of the same family. In addition, the effect of these genetic variations is thought to be influenced by interactions with other genes and environmental factors, as well as lifestyle.The interdisciplinary work of Dr. Jacques R. Simard, Canada Research Chair in Oncogenetics, will help improve the tools used to assess breast cancer risk by determining genetic risk factors. Simard’s research will also increase our understanding of how this information can be communicated to patients, their families and health professionals in order to ensure its usefulness in a clinical setting and its impact on the health of populations at risk. Simard has taken part in many international studies with the aim of significantly increasing the clinical use of genetic risk profiles. These profiles can make it easier to identify persons at risk who could benefit most from strategies for prevention and early detection. "

The Canadian health care system is at a critical juncture because of rapidly rising costs and increasing demand for modern health services. Wait times in emergency rooms, difficulties finding a family physician, limited access to specialized services and communication failures between health organizations are all symptoms of the coordination challenges facing the health care system.Billions of dollars are invested every year in emerging technologies; however, information technology often performs with less success than expected in health care because of organizational, cultural and implementation issues.As Canada Research Chair in Technology, Management and Health Care, Dr. Samer Faraj studies how information technology is transforming work and the provision of health care. Faraj relies on intensive fieldwork to understand how medical teams work together to share expertise and deliver care, and how information technology changes cross-disciplinary and cross-site collaboration.Faraj’s research will address two specific topics—first, how health stakeholders respond to the possibilities created by new technologies; and second, how emerging types of coordination develop in medical settings where different expertise needs to be integrated.An effective health care system requires a digital infrastructure that supports all the different ways information is shared. By studying the integration of information technologies, and how to improve medical work organization and coordination, Faraj hopes to identify ways to significantly improve health care. "

Over 30 million people around the world were living with HIV and AIDS as of 2008. The UN estimates that 2.5 million people were newly diagnosed as HIV-positive in 2007 alone. As the devastating global pandemic continues to exact a terrible human and economic toll, scientists are continuing to search for a vaccine that will prevent it from spreading further. However, because the spread of AIDS is linked to normal human behaviour, efforts to prevent and control it come not only with their own biomedical challenges, but with social and cultural ones, too. It isn’t a case of just waiting for scientists to find a vaccine that works. Experimental vaccines must be safely and ethically tested. If they’re proven viable, they would still have to be distributed in a way that made them widely acceptable and accessible, and didn’t increase risk behaviours among vulnerable populations. Even in Canada there would be many challenges to successfully implementing an AIDS vaccine. In the developing world, however, poverty and lack of public health infrastructures would make it even more complicated. Among the first researchers to address AIDS vaccine acceptability, Dr. Peter Newman, Canada Research Chair in Health and Social Justice, believes it is essential that the best biomedical science and best social science work together to support the quest for a safe and effective vaccine. His research focuses both on preparing for clinical trials of AIDS vaccines and on how acceptable such a vaccine would be considered to be once it was developed. As part of his research, Newman will look at what have been called “local vaccination cultures” in Canada and the developing world, including local beliefs about health, medicine, and HIV/AIDS, and will identify what motivates people to participate, or keeps them from participating, in drug trials and vaccination programs. Newman will also look at the potential impact of hypothetical vaccines. For example, if a successfully tested vaccine were 50 per cent effective, you would expect it to have an enormous impact on infection rates. But, asks Newman, would receiving it make people more likely to then engage in behaviours that put them at risk, thereby actually compromising the overall effectiveness of the vaccine? Newman’s research will lead to best practices for community engagement in clinical trials and future AIDS vaccine dissemination, including HIV education and prevention programs for a post-vaccine world, helping make any potential vaccine even more effective.

These two diseases, along with diabetes and respiratory disease, are responsible for 75 per cent of all Canadian deaths.But, while every breakthrough matters, Canadians can't count on new treatments alone. The cost of treating these four chronic diseases is reason enough—$40 billion per year in direct and indirect costs, a number set to rise even higher in coming years. Already, one third of hospital resources are consumed with these diseases. And, economics aside, one simple fact remains: no treatment will ever work all the time—so not getting a disease in the first place is always the best option.As Canada Research Chair in the Early Determinants of Adult Chronic Disease, Dr. Jennifer L. O’Loughlin wants to make sure we do everything we can to help the next generation of Canadians avoid the burden of chronic disease. What’s more, she wants to make sure health promotion focuses on all Canadians, not just those at high risk. That means starting in childhood, where research suggests many chronic diseases begin. She’ll also investigate environmental and genetic roots of disease, which more and more research suggests may play key roles.Her research will include long-term studies of children and adolescents, through which she’ll try to understand the relative importance of genetic, behavioural and environmental causes of common problems like insulin resistance, obesity and nicotine dependence. O‘Loughlin will then design, implement and assess a variety of health-promotion programs that try to prevent these conditions from developing.Throughout her research career, O‘Loughlin has been committed not just to discovering new prevention strategies, but also to sharing these with practitioners. Her work will result in new policies and new promotion plans, teaching us how to create a healthier generation of Canadians who can count on more than luck to avoid the chronic diseases that plague so many people today.

One third of the world’s boreal forest stands in Canada, where hundreds of communities depend exclusively on the forest for their livelihood. The forest has particularly great social, economic and cultural importance for the majority of Canada’s Aboriginal communities, located in forests that are being logged. However, there is still only very limited consideration for the Aboriginal viewpoint in the planning and monitoring of forestry management activities. It is at the crossroads of traditional and scientific knowledge that we can find the tools that allow for genuine integrated resource management, under which the land is shared by the different users in accordance with the needs of each. Hugo Asselin, Canada Research Chair in Aboriginal Forestry, is an expert on the dynamics of boreal forest ecosystems, including their human component. His studies seek primarily to allow a better understanding of the centuries-old dynamics of forest ecosystems so as to define their historical variability and find indicators in the past for interpreting the present and forecasting the future. What is involved is better integrating traditional and scientific knowledge with a view to sustainable forestry management. Last, the research will lead to the development of tools to support decision-making, thereby enhancing the ability of Aboriginal communities to evaluate the different forestry management options proposed to them so that they can determine how acceptable each is in social, environmental and economic terms. Dr. Asselin’s work is contributing to the maintenance and development of sustainable communities, and to equitable sharing of the land.

As Canada Research Chair in Molecular and Cellular Biomechanics, Dr. Walter Herzog will shed light on some of the mysteries of this remarkable process.Researchers are still uncovering how these molecular motors use chemical energy to transport molecules. In addition to exploring this process, Herzog will also be studying a problem that is familiar to anyone who has seen a wobbly-legged astronaut returning from space. Their bones and muscles are less dense and more brittle because their bodies have adapted to the lack of gravitational loading, an adaptation that involves the molecular transport system. But the precise mechanisms of how mechanical loading produces tissue adaptation are still unknown. By understanding this adaptation, Herzog hopes to discover new ways to treat injuries and detect, prevent and treat diseases like osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, and fibromyalgia. He will also be studying the skeletal muscle motor myosin and actin to determine how these proteins interact physically, and how relative motion between them is achieved. Having already won many awards for his research, Herzog will contribute even more to the field of musculoskeletal biomechanics. His work will be immediately helpful to an aging population that will suffer from a variety of muscoskelatel ailments. It will also help other health researchers by shedding new light on a process that is fundamental to almost everything our bodies do. "

Dr. Jeffrey Meyer, Canada Research Chair in Neurochemistry of Major Depressive Disorder, wants to improve this situation. He is developing new approaches for treating MDD using positron emission tomography (PET). PET is a technique that produces a three-dimensional image of the brain. This allows Meyer to see the brain’s inner workings and measure the effectiveness of treatments and prevention strategies. There are a variety of pathologies (conditions affecting the brain) that can create depression. Meyer and his research team will examine the markers of pathologies that are resistant to current antidepressants. They will then identify subsets of MDD with common pathologies and determine whether drugs or natural health products currently used to treat other diseases might also offer relief to those suffering from the disorder. But Meyer isn’t just hoping to discover new treatments. He is also exploring ways to prevent MDD. Meyer is examining how diverse circumstances—like substance abuse, light exposure, giving birth and perimenopause—can lead to changes in the brain that cause MDD. He hopes his findings will help identify natural health products that can minimize the effects of these conditions and prevent the development of MDD. "

Doble is leading research at McMaster University’s Stem Cell and Cancer Research Institute to refine what researchers know about the signalling, or communication, pathways in cells involved in the development of cancer.“Understanding the details will allow us to target the specific problems that are causing cancer,” says Doble, an expert in cell signalling (the communication system between cells that governs what they do and how they work together) and embryonic stem cell biology. Stem cell research has become particularly important in studying cancer, since it turns out the same signalling pathways linked to cancer are also involved in regulating normal stem cell properties. Doble’s research looks, specifically, at GSK-3 (glycogen synthase kinase), a regulatory protein particularly important for the basic functioning of cells. He is using genetically engineered mouse stem cells to study GSK-3’s role in these pathways in normal stem cell biology and in cancer.“The long-term goal is to understand the core pathways involved in certain types of cancer,” says Doble. “GSK-3 plays a very prominent role in regulating several signalling pathways that are implicated in cancer.

Dr., Marnina Gonick and her colleagues believe that, at least in part, the changes are an effect of neo-liberal ideologies and policies, with their focus on dismantling state structures and creating a new contract between the state and its citizens. This new political landscape, they say, has been demanding a new kind of subject: one who understands his or herself as an autonomous agent, a producer of their present and their future, an inventor of the people they are or may become.As Canada Research Chair in Gender Identity and Social Practices, Gonick is looking at how establishing these new roles has led to both unprecedented opportunities and further limitations for changing identities around gender. Most centrally, she says, modern Western women are no longer just being seen in light of the historical idea of being either a woman or a person. Girls and women are not only recognized as subjects, or citizens, in discussions about neo-liberalism, says Gonick, but are its ideal subject.Working with the Atlantic Centre for Research and Education of Girls and Women, Gonick will explore the implications of these changes for the lives of girls and women. To do this, her ethnographic projects will focus on family, schooling, popular culture and media representations of femininity and girlhood.

For example, in 2007 some scientists claimed that sea lice, common on many salmon farms, would lead to the extinction of pink salmon in a number of important rivers in British Columbia within a decade. While other scientists contested the assertion, it illustrated the importance of comprehensive data sets and analytical tools that could provide scientists, government officials and farmers alike the hard evidence they needed to understand and control the spread of the disease.As Canada Research Chair in Population Health: Epi-Informatics, Dr. Crawford Revie is exploring new ways to use techniques from informatics—such as data mining, data-driven modelling and semantic web technologies—to gain a better understanding of disease epidemiology.

Developing effective strategies to protect this hidden resource is not only critical to Canada’s economy but can also help maintain natural ecosystems and protect our health.Improving our ability to predict the flow of groundwater and groundwater contaminants is the focus of research being conducted by Dr. John Molson, Canada Research Chair in Quantitative Hydrogeology of Fractured Porous Media.Molson will focus on developing new mathematical computer models which solve the physical laws governing the flow of groundwater and transport of contaminants in fractured hydrogeologic systems. A groundwater flow system can be simulated on a computer, or modelled, based on its geometry, material properties and structure and on its surrounding environment and use. Molson is applying these mathematical models to assess new remediation technologies for contaminated groundwater, and to predict risks from new environmental contaminants and impacts on groundwater from climate change.Molson’s research will lead to better groundwater protection, management and remediation strategies. His research will also be highly relevant to rural and municipal governments responsible for water supply and protection and to the mining, petroleum, waste disposal and environmental consulting industries (especially those involved in groundwater remediation and water supply in sensitive northern climates).

Before Christopher Somers’ work, we knew that contaminants in our air and water could cause genetic damage leading to cancer, but we didn’t know that pollution can also cause mutations that are passed from one generation to the next. Somers’ research examines the frequency of DNA mutations in the sperm or eggs of wild birds and other animals exposed to environmental pollution. These mutations can be passed on to their offspring. This scenario is fascinating because it is so different from other aspects of toxicology. The impacts of pollution in this case are felt by individuals that didn’t even experience the exposure.Somers approaches this phenomena from a number of angles. In the field, he studies the behaviour, breeding and diet of birds to understand how they are exposed to contaminants. He is particularly interested in urban species—such as pigeons or sparrows—because these birds share habitats, and thereby pollution exposure, with humans. Somers then takes DNA samples from complete families of birds and genetically profiles parents and offspring to detect mutations that are passed to the next generation.In the lab, Somers has housed experiments with mice outdoors in order to isolate particular types of pollution exposure. These experiments have shown that industrial air pollution can create mutations from one generation to the next. This finding is especially important, as millions of humans and other animals worldwide are exposed to air pollution. The relationships between mutations that are passed down to subsequent generations and pollution exposure identified by Somers’ research support wildlife conservation and habitat protection, while helping scientists better understand the risks of genetic mutation in humans.

In Ontario alone, the amount is more than $100 billion. But we can’t take these contributions for granted. To be globally competitive, we have to be first to market. We also have to encourage innovation and be on the leading edge of automotive technology. To that end, Dr. Amir Khajepour, Canada Research Chair in Mechatronic Vehicle Systems, is promoting revolutionary concepts and innovations for a wide range of automotive systems and technologies. He does this by encouraging students and researchers to “think outside of the box.” Khajepour aims to improve the efficiency of combustion engines, develop technologies for safer, environmentally friendly vehicles, and develop systems to reduce or eliminate vehicle idling. He will draw on the expertise of a diverse research team to enable rapid innovation through collaborative projects. Khajepour and his team will focus on technology transfer to industry, putting theory into practice and building lasting partnerships with Canada’s leading manufacturers. They will train the next generation of engineers to support our automotive industry, and will encourage elementary and high school students to study engineering and science through a youth outreach program. Ultimately, Khajepour’s work will lead to new technologies for designing and popularizing urban vehicles, more efficient internal combustion engines, and anti-idling systems for service vehicles. "

Central to the research program of Dr. R. Tom Baker, Canada Research Chair in Catalysis Science for Energy Applications, are new tandem catalysis processes contributing to these three areas of energy research.Baker will investigate new catalysts that can be designed and developed to enable chemical reactions with reduced energy input and waste production. Application of state-of-the-art catalysis science to low temperature conversion of biomass-derived carbohydrates to diesel fuels, for example, will supplement the need for fossil fuels to move goods and people by land and air.In addition to its heavy output of carbon dioxide, combustion of carbon-based fuels produces oxides of nitrogen and sulphur and small carbon particulates, all of which are harmful to humans. In contrast, burning hydrogen in a fuel cell produces only power and water, but improved on-board storage is required to avoid the need for frequent refuelling. Baker’s research on high-capacity amine-borane storage materials seeks to identify new catalysts that maximize the rate and extent of hydrogen release.Improved fossil fuel utilization through tandem catalysis will extend the lifetime of Canada’s oil and gas resources and reduce emissions at existing oil refineries and gas flares. Effective hydrogen storage will benefit vehicles ranging from farm tractors to long-haul cargo trucks, and the development of new biofuel processes could offer increased economic activity at all stages of the value chain.

At the time, logicians studied the ancient Greek philosopher by commenting on his works and, from there, developed their own, distinctively medieval extensions of it. For a medieval intellectual, Aristotle-based logic served as more than just the first subject on the school or university curriculum. Logic in the middle ages comprised what we would now call theories of argumentation, where thinkers reached conclusions through logical (often verbal) reasoning — claims based on premises. This logic formed the basis for virtually all metaphysical doctrines and its influence throughout intellectual culture in the middle ages is immeasurable. Yet, research around medieval logic remains incomplete. Dr. Margaret Cameron will examine its early development, especially the tradition that began at the turn of the 12th century in the Latin west, before the advent of the medieval university. The Canada Research Chair in the Aristotelian Tradition aims to answer why so many different intellectuals were, so to speak, ‘doing logic’ at this time. In addition to interpreting and analyzing their logical projects, Cameron’s study will examine the social and cultural history behind medieval logic, including the ways it was taught and transmitted, as well as its role in shaping the broader intellectual culture of the time. Cameron also intends to utilize digital technologies to create a virtual research centre for studying medieval logic and its role in intellectual history. Dialectica: The Digital Medieval Aristotelian Logic Project will create an online resource where international scholars can work together. The long-term goal is to produce a series of translations of medieval logic that will help bring philosophical materials to a wider audience. "

And, how does all of this relate to what we know about which side of the brain is most responsible for language and other cognitive functions? These are some of the questions being investigated by Dr. Claudia Gonzalez, Canadian Research Chair in Sensorimotor Control. Among other things, Gonzalez’s research is providing insight into what causes hand dominance and “language lateralization,” the tendency for one hemisphere of the human brain to specialize in language. Her research is also examining motor, sensory and cognitive abnormalities that can arise during childhood or after brain damage, along with innovative interventions for people with such abnormalities. Her long-term goal is to improve our understanding of brain asymmetry, organization and function. For example, Gonzalez’s work has shown that, in children, the more the right hand is used for precision grasping, the better the child’s executive function—that is, their working memory, reasoning, problem-solving and planning—is likely to be. As well, the more the right hand is used to grasp things to eat, the more proficient a child’s speech production is. Together, these results are not only offering useful information about the origins of human language, but may help researchers, physicians, patients and teachers understand a range of issues related to speech and cognitive abilities.

The oceans are acidifying and getting warmer, rivers and lakes are aging more quickly, and previously flourishing species are disappearing and being replaced by other, often very undesirable, species instead. How should we measure and respond to these changes? How should we change our practices to limit our impact on aquatic ecosystems? These are the questions that Yannick Huot is tackling as the Canada Research Chair in Earth Observation and Phytoplankton Ecophysiology. Huot hopes to find answers to these questions by focusing on phytoplankton—the microscopic organisms that are the foundation of the biological production of aquatic ecosystems. Like terrestrial plants, phytoplankton captures solar energy and becomes food for animals. Thus all marine animals, from the tiniest shrimp to the blue whale, need phytoplankton to live. Huot’s wide-ranging research activities take him from the laboratory (where he studies the physiology of key aquatic system species) to the oceans (where he uses satellite imagery to make observations of the distribution and growth of the microscopic organisms concerned). His goal is to generate models of the target systems in order to identify the key factors of which we need to gain an understanding, and predict changes in those factors. The results of the research conducted by Huot and his team will yield a deeper understanding of the effect of human disturbances on the aquatic environment and help establish a reliable scientific basis for developing watershed management policy.

The advent of genome sequencing and functional genomics technologies, as well as the availability of genome sequences for an ever-increasing number of species, has brought in a golden age for genetics research. By means of computational and experimental comparative genomics approaches, a comprehensive survey of inter- and intra-species genetic diversity now becomes possible, and their functional impacts can be assessed using functional genomics methodologies.As Canada Research Chair in Genomics and Bioinformatics, Dr. Ping Liang is particularly interested in a class of genetic components called transposable elements, which exist in abundance and evolve actively in the genomes of most organisms, including humans. Liang has already made significant contributions to this field by developing several computational comparative genomics methodologies and the database of Retrotransposon Insertion Polymorphisms in humans (dbRIP).

There is a wide variety of living creatures on this planet, yet one of the great unanswered questions in biology is how this variety came to be. Knowing more about how diverse species arise is critical to our understanding of evolution and our ability to conserve endangered species and maintain biodiversity. Some key unanswered questions are: What genetic changes might cause one continuous population to diverge into two distinct species? What prevents them from merging back together? Research by Dr. Amanda Moehring, Canada Research Chair in Functional Genomics, aims to answer these questions by focusing on the genetic changes that cause new species to form and thrive. Moehring’s work examines both hybrid sterility and the genetics of behavioural isolation. Hybrid sterility refers to sterility among offspring caused by matings between species. Behavioural isolation prevents interspecies matings from happening in the first place. Since most genetic studies require researchers to cross pairs of individuals, hybrid sterility and behavioural isolation make it difficult to identify the genes involved in species isolation. Moehring overcomes these challenges by using the fruit fly as a model system. Along with a wide array of genetic and genomic tools, this allows her to cross species pairs in the laboratory to produce fertile offspring. Moehring’s research will provide insight into how new species arise, and will enhance our general understanding of why behavioural traits vary among species. Her work may allow us to one day understand how individuals recognize members of their own species, and why some are fertile while others are not. "

The bow movement creates vibrations that produce sounds, forcing the sand grains to dance. At first, the sand picture looks shapeless and the sound is annoying. However, as the frequency of vibrations increases and reaches a certain threshold, the sound suddenly becomes pure and the sand forms a beautiful symmetric pattern. Within seconds it gets destroyed. As the next frequency threshold is reached, an even more fascinating pattern emerges, accompanied by another pure tone.When the German musician and physicist Ernst Chladni performed this experiment in front of Napoleon Bonaparte in 1809, the link between the formation of sand shapes and pure sounds was not understood. The French emperor was so intrigued that he offered Chladni 6,000 francs to continue his investigations, and established a prize of 3,000 francs for finding an explanation of the patterns—claimed in 1816 by the French mathematician Sophie Germain. Today, this remarkable phenomenon—that pure sounds can also be seen—is well-known in spectral geometry. The thresholds of ""pure sound"" correspond to the resonance frequencies of the plate, and the grains of sand, trying to minimize their energy, concentrate along the zero sets of the amplitudes.Despite the ground-breaking works of past scientists, Dr. Iosif Polterovich believes our understanding of vibration and sound propagation remains incomplete. The Canada Research Chair in Geometry and Spectral Theory will research various areas of geometric spectral theory. One of them, called isospectrality, is motivated by the famous question ""Can one hear the shape of a drum?"", asked by Mark Kac more than 40 years ago.If one can see sounds, why not hear shapes? "

We need only look at our classification of historic and prehistoric periods (e.g., the Stone Age and Iron Age) to understand how important discovering and developing new materials can be. Today, there are no new materials with unprecedented properties that we can simply dig up from the ground. For the most part, we already understand the properties of naturally occurring materials and it is highly unlikely we will stumble upon anything that behaves differently. New materials with new properties must therefore be prepared in synthetic chemistry laboratories. On the long list of materials chemists are attempting to prepare, compounds that exhibit “spintronic” (spin-based electronic) properties are at the top. The development of new materials that exhibit unprecedented spintronic properties is crucial to advancing data technology. The realization of quantum computing, for example, relies on the development of efficient and inexpensive spintronic materials. Perhaps the most sought after spintronic material is one in which semi-conductivity and ferro- or ferri-magnetism occur in the same temperature regime. The design of such materials at a molecular level is the ultimate goal of the research pursued by Canada Research Chair in the Chemistry of Molecular Materials, Dr. Kathryn Preuss. Preuss and her team of researchers will focus on the design and synthesis of molecules possessing metallic and organic components. Each component holds unpaired electrons with the potential to interact or communicate with one another, giving rise to the desired magnetic and conductive properties. Preuss’s research goal is to make a molecular material that will revolutionize data storage, quantum computing and semiconductors by increasing efficiency, reducing size and tapping into properties unknown in currently existing materials.

Ford’s great leap forward revolutionized manufacturing itself through automation and innovative designs. Dr. Yu Sun, Canada Research Chair in Micro- and Nano-Engineering Systems, is poised at a similar juncture in medical research as he engineers systems with the potential to affect areas from cancer screening to tissue engineering. But instead of cars, he’s looking at changing the way we handle cells.Much biological research requires physical manipulation and characterization of cells. Today, this is done manually and can be a slow process, prone to human error. It also means results are hard to reproduce, which is critical for scientific advancements to be validated. Sun is engineering high-speed, automated ways to process cells. For example, it’s been known for years that cancer cells and normal cells are mechanically different. To detect cancer in this way, biologists manually characterize cells—a process that covers 10 cells per minute at best. With Sun’s technologies, 2,000 cells could be dealt with every 20 minutes or less. Cancer screening is but one of several applications that Sun’s team is investigating. They are also collaborating on assisted reproduction, genetics, stem cell creation and molecule screening. Regardless of application, the principle remains the same: find ways to automate and speed-up cell manipulation and characterization via technologies and micro, nano-robotics. Breaking down the barriers presented by manual cell manipulation and characterization means that major discoveries can be turned into clinical and practical applications. Sun has already developed prototype technologies and expects to have them up and running within five years. "

Moore observed that the number of transistors placed inexpensively on an integrated circuit had increased exponentially, doubling approximately every two years since the circuit’s invention.Since then, the relentless advance of Moore’s Law has brought us to the point where transistors are switched on and off with a few hundred electrons. And while there are obstacles to continue shrinking transistors, new opportunities exist at tiny, nanometer-length scales. As Canada Research Chair in Nanoscale Electronics, Dr. Thomas Szkopek is working to continue Moore’s Law using graphene, a single atomic layer of carbon that electrons can flow through with surprisingly little resistance. Transistors fashioned from graphene have a number of remarkable properties, including ultra-high electron velocity and sensitive chemical-sensing ability. The carbon’s optical properties are equally remarkable, as a single layer can be seen using a standard light microscope.Through his graphene research, Szkopek will develop new materials and transistors that drastically improve the performance of electronic devices, pushing them towards the limits imposed by fundamental physical laws.

There she learned about the history of Western Canada, witnessed the diversity of First Nations through object displays, and sought to understand the personal stories found within the archives. As a historian and educator with a specific interest in museums as educational institutions, Trofanenko continues to visit museums and other cultural heritage institutions to study how such institutions hold authority in defining who we are as individuals and as communities. She is particularly interested in how such institutions distinguish and define disciplinary knowledge. Trofanenko is also interested in how museums and cultural heritage institutions are changing. Over the past 20 years, museums have begun to re-examine their public role. This has prompted museums to reconsider what defines culture, how it is displayed publicly and how they work with various groups they purport to represent. By examining their purposes, Trofanenko will investigate how museums are negotiating between their historically defined mandates and the societal forces that have prompted their establishment. She will also investigate how these institutions are utilizing digital technologies to shape the way knowledge is created, communicated and influenced by public museums. Using the results of Trofanenko’s research, museums and cultural heritage institutions around the world will be able to re-evaluate their strategies, reconsider museums’ educational intent, and further develop working relationships with the various communities they seek to represent.

Exciting possibilities exist for reprogramming cells by changing the complex sugar structure on their surfaces (in other words, rewriting the label) and thereby controlling biological processes. Unfortunately these molecular “baggage tags” can also be “read” by viruses and bacteria, and used as a point of invasion. To counter this process, decoy sugars can be used to trick the invading pathogens. The two approaches described both depend on efficient methods to synthesise the complex sugar structures on a large scale. However, this is not currently feasible with the standard approaches of organic chemistry. A solution to this dilemma would be to recruit nature’s synthetic chemists—enzymes—to help with this task. However, few of the enzymes required are currently available.Dr. Stephen Withers, Canada Research Chair in Chemical Biology, has developed methods to reprogram the enzymes that ordinarily degrade complex sugars so that they synthesise the sugars instead. He has also developed methods to improve the activities of these enzymes, or even re-engineer them to new tasks, by mimicking the process of natural selection. Using such approaches, Withers will generate strategies to rapidly create “designer” catalysts for the assembly of any complex sugar required. This will lead to new treatments for a variety of infectious and genetic diseases. "

By addressing questions like these, Dr. Imre Szeman, Canada Research Chair in Cultural Studies, is researching the increasingly complex and multifaceted ways in which we understand culture in the 21st century. The enormous changes in the speed and scale of everyday life in the era of globalization have created new challenges for the study of culture. Existing ideas about the spaces and places of culture have been transformed; innovative technologies have created new forms of culture, including new ways of transmitting and reproducing cultural forms, old and new; and culture has now become an important engine of development, whether through “creative cities” initiatives, cultural tourism, or the expansion of the global entertainment industry. Szeman’s research studies the impact of these developments on both cultural practices and the theories used to study culture.

Many of these patients go on to develop chronic kidney failure and require dialysis or kidney transplantation. Currently, there are few diagnostic tests to shed light on the cause of kidney disease. Furthermore, while controlling diet, blood pressure and other cardiovascular risk factors can have an impact, almost no treatments exist that are specific to kidney diseases or to the prevention of kidney failure. Dr. Daniel Muruve, Canada Research Chair in Inflammation and Personalized Medicine in Kidney Disease, believes there is a critical need to better understand the causes of kidney disease at a cellular, molecular and genetic level.

However, only in the past decades have researchers started to explore the molecular links between the clotting system and the inflammatory system. Most of these links can be traced to “endothelial” cells (the cells that line blood vessels), where the two systems interact the most intimately. Dr. Edward Conway, Canada Research Chair in Endothelial Cell Biology, believes that by understanding how endothelial cells work, researchers will be able to develop new and more effective preventative and therapeutic strategies for common blood-vessel diseases such as venous thrombosis and atherosclerosis.As a clinical scientist, Conway has led research groups in Canada and Europe. His research has already determined that mutations in the proteins of endothelial cells in humans may contribute to vascular (blood vessel) disease, and has started applying his discoveries to test different therapies. Although scientists had already learned that one of these endothelial cell proteins, called “thrombomodulin,” is essential for preventing excess blood clotting, Conway was the first to discover its importance for our immune response to infections and for inflammation. He is currently working to further understand the exact role that it and others play. Conway’s goal is to investigate how thrombomodulin and its protein partners work; determine how mutations in thrombomodulin may contribute to vascular, immune, inflammatory, infectious and malignant diseases in humans; and to develop new treatment strategies based on this new-found knowledge.Conway’s research could have a wide impact, leading to new genetic insights to explain both common and rare diseases, and to develop innovative treatment approaches.

Governments also fear their hard-won emission reductions will be offset by increased emissions in other countries. Dr. Carol McAusland, Canada Research Chair in Trade and Environment, is working on a solution: destination-based carbon policy. With this policy, rather than taxing greenhouse gases when they are released, emissions would be taxed when goods are consumed. The benefit of destination-based carbon policy is that Canadian producers would not face competitive disadvantages relative to imports from countries taking no action on climate change: instead, all goods consumed in Canada would be taxed according to their carbon footprint regardless of where they were made. McAusland is assessing the economic, legal and logistical aspects of implementing a destination-based carbon policy via a carbon footprint tax (CFT). The basis for such a tax would be all of the greenhouse gases emitted during any item’s production chain, as well as any hidden emissions contained in the item itself. McAusland and her research team are analyzing a cost-saving hybrid version of the CFT, in which firms have the option of having their goods taxed on product-specific baselines rather than having to calculate actual footprints. McAusland’s work examines the feasibility of a hybrid CFT in light of Canada’s membership in the World Trade Organization, its trade relationships with partners at different development levels, and the make-up of domestic industry, consumption and exports.

What’s less well understood is how the information contained in the DNA gets decoded. How does each creature “read” the right information to develop into an adult, or to adapt its lifestyle successfully to outside influences? A process known as “transcription” is needed for any organism to correctly interpret the information contained in DNA. Transcription needs to happen at the right time and in the right place. When it doesn’t, diseases such as cancer and diabetes can result. As Canada Research Chair in Transcriptional Regulatory Networks, Dr. Stefan Taubert’s mission is to understand why and how faulty transcription leads to abnormal development or illness. Taubert and his research team use worms and mice as experimental models to study how changes in transcription affect biological processes, like organ development or response to food quality and quantity. Taubert is focusing his research on the so-called “Mediator,” a molecular machine needed for transcription. Without it, an organism cannot decode DNA. Some parts of the Mediator are mutated in specific human diseases, including certain types of cancer and some neurodevelopmental disorders. Taubert and his research team want to define how these Mediator parts promote normal development and maintain metabolic balance, and why their mutation leads to disease.

From Toronto to Tokyo, it has become common to hear that our privacy is disappearing. There are closed-circuit television cameras on street corners, drones flying overhead, ever-tighter border controls, and governments and companies collecting as much data as possible about us. The data collected by these systems is increasingly used in “smart city” initiatives, which try to harness the power of surveillance and big data for urban management. Smart cities combine multiple kinds of data—from weather to crime patterns—with the aim of anticipating and averting risks before things go wrong. With the help of international research partners in the United States and the United Kingdom, Dr. David Murakami Wood, Canada Research Chair in Surveillance Studies, is examining whether these smart cities really make us “smarter” or actually create social injustice and challenge our rights to privacy by building surveillance into our urban environment. Murakami Wood wants to move beyond simply accepting the increased level of electronic scrutiny of our daily lives, and shed light on potential responses to surveillance while providing new ways of understanding, debating, reacting to and controlling it.

Smaller, more powerful devices are needed to meet endless consumer hunger for increased computer memory, more advanced cell phone and audio devices, and higher-resolution digital cameras. Yet this trend isn’t sustainable unless we develop new components with characteristics beyond those used today. Enter nano-devices—objects one hundred thousand times smaller than the width of a human hair, but still able, for instance, to collect light or operate a digital camera. These high-tech devices have been demonstrated to work, but can’t be used in mass production thanks to their high cost and problems performing on designated positions of an electronic chip or platform.Dr. Giovanni Fanchini, Canada Research Chair in Carbon-based Nanomaterials and Nano-optoelectronics, will solve these problems. He is exploring new, cheap and more user-friendly ways to create, manipulate and test electronic and optical nano-devices. Fanchini’s devices are assembled from plastics and other low-cost organic materials, using techniques that involve dissolving the materials in droplets of various liquids, from which the nano-devices are “traced,” like pictures drawn from ink on the tip of a pen.Fanchini’s laboratory is a nano-optoelectronics shop fully equipped to develop prototype nano-devices that could dramatically improve, and even completely transform, electronic devices we use every day, such as our mobile phones and our personal computers.

",Exploring the Relationship Between Infections in Animals and People," Exploring the Relationship Between Infections in Animals and People Diseases that spread from animals to humans, known as “zoonotic diseases,” pose an enormous challenge to public and animal health. Researchers have estimated that over 60 per cent of known and 75 per cent of emerging human infectious diseases started in animals, and many of these have catastrophic potential.It turns out that many of these diseases come from, and still others are spread by, our pets, which researchers are identifying as reservoirs of multidrug-resistant pathogens. The route these diseases travel from their animal to their human hosts, however, are often complicated, requiring research spanning everywhere from the laboratory to households, farms, veterinary hospitals and the environment. Dr. J. Scott Weese, Canada Research Chair in Zoonotic Diseases, is a leading researcher on two important zoonotic pathogens— methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, also known as “MRSA,” and Clostridium difficile—as well as other established and emerging pathogens. By simultaneously studying people, animals and food, Weese’s research team is learning about the frequency of and factors associated with transmissions of infectious diseases from animals to humans. Weese is also a leader in veterinary infection control, and his program will translate research findings into practical and effective infection-control measures for households, farms and hospitals (both human and veterinary). Weese’s work will provide important insights into various infectious diseases, and will improve our understanding of how zoonotic pathogens spread, and how we can control them.

Participating in group activities at both the recreational and competitive level is a major part of maintaining an active lifestyle.

Many of Canada’s favourite ”individual” activities (e.g., golf, running) also take place in group settings.Canada Research Chair in Group Dynamics and Physical Activity Dr. Mark Eys is studying the underlying dynamics of sport and exercise groups, with the ultimate goal of creating effective interventions to increase individual physical activity levels and improve group performance in sports.A number of issues are important to consider when examining sport and exercise groups.

Although cultural rights are perhaps the least known and elaborated upon of the categories of human rights, they are increasingly significant in the assertion of social justice claims. The principles of cultural rights are now incorporated into interpretations and applications of many international legal instruments and in the practices of institutions such as the World Bank, international aid agencies, and non-governmental organizations. Whether the objective is rural development, environmental sustainability or rights-based development, an emphasis upon maintaining, and, in some cases, profiting from, cultural distinction has assumed new significance in international arenas. In this process, relationships between the ""local"" and the ""global"" are reconfigured and alternative forms of sovereignty are articulated.Coombe considers the relationship between neo-liberalism and cultural rights, exploring new forms of governmentality and characteristic subjectivities that seek to empower local communities, recognize traditions as sources of social capital and otherwise demand that peoples adopt an entrepreneurial attitude towards their “culture” and the social relations of reproduction that have traditionally sustained them.

Populations of wild animals change over time from individual losses (mortality or emigration) and gains (reproduction or immigration). The populations may also be influenced by human activity, like hunting and fishing, or habitat destruction and modification. To prevent species extinction and ensure exploitation that is sustainable both environmentally and economically, it is essential to understand the phenomena that influence the population level of different species. Dr. Fanie Pelletier, Canada Research Chair in Evolutionary Demography and Conservation, is leading studies that seek to understand how wild animal population numbers are influenced by environmental variations, such as climate or food availability, as well as by human activity. She conducts her research in open-air laboratories, using innovative techniques to individually follow all the animals of a species living in a particular region. With the help of global positioning systems or genetic screening, Pelletier can track, in real time, wild animals’ behaviour, survival and reproduction. Among other things, this detailed monitoring enables her to determine the causes of mortality (sickness, predation, hunting) most likely to affect population growth. Pelletier’s work leads to the possibility of establishing protected areas to ensure the conservation of declining species, and also contributes to fisheries and hunting management. "

The United Kingdom has one video surveillance camera per 14 inhabitants. Canada has only one per 10,000 inhabitants. In contrast, Canada authorizes electronic eavesdropping on communications between its citizens more often than most other countries. This shows that risk is the outcome of an assessment that can vary in different societies, and that risk management requires social control measures of varying nature and scope. Undoubtedly the most important of these measures is surveillance, which may take various forms. But surveillance does not only help with social control; it also reveals risks never before imagined that now must be tracked. The interconnections between surveillance and risk thus plays a key role in shaping relations between the individual and society—particularly the way that individual behaviour is controlled and standardized. To better understand the shaping of relations between individual and society, Stéphane Leman-Langlois, Canada Research Chair in Surveillance and the Social Construction of Risk, is studying both surveillance practices and risk representations. Under this innovative approach, Leman-Langlois will look at surveillance from a social and political perspective, and will connect attitudes toward the concept of ""risk"" with practices emerging from and supporting those attitudes. Leman-Langlois’s research will help Canadians put into context and assess the surveillance strategies and technologies to which they are subjected. "

As a result, these multi-language systems are more complex and bugs can cross the “borders” between programming languages, making them difficult to track. In his work as Canada Research Chair in Patterns of Multilingual Systems, Dr. Yann-Gaël Guéhéneuc is looking to develop improved patterns and analyses to help develop, understand, and debug these multi-language systems. Many bugs occur because of the sheer complexity of debugging these multi-language—and interconnected—systems. For example, when a bug occurred in Facebook’s “Connect” feature—the software that allows users to log into other websites using their Facebook identifications—users were prevented from visiting other sites, such as CNN and The New York Times. This glitch demonstrates how a bug can have a ripple effect across systems developed using different programming languages. Current patterns and analyses meant to help developers write, understand and debug these systems are inadequate because they do not take into account the interactions between programming languages and the problems that can result from these interactions. Guéhéneuc’s research will provide developers with analyses dedicated to multi-language systems and help them build better, more robust systems in the future. "

These structures are usually immersed in fluids: air or liquid. Interaction between these thin-walled shell structures and fluids may give rise to large-amplitude vibrations and instability, which need to be controlled to prevent the shell’s failure. Fluid-structure interactions in aerospace applications are particularly challenging, since they involve new materials with lesser-known properties. As Canada Research Chair in Vibrations and Fluid-Structure Interaction, Dr. Marco Amabili studies nonlinear dynamics (the study of how a small change in one variable can lead to a large, systemic change) and stability, fluid-structure interactions, and active control of shell structures, particularly for aeronautical and underwater vehicles. The increasing need to produce lighter-weight aerospace shell structures has led to the use of advanced material systems and the demand for new design methods to guide product development. Amabili is seeking to develop solutions to open problems in the nonlinear dynamics of shell structures through groundbreaking innovations in experimental, theoretical and numerical techniques. His work also seeks to merge branches of research that have in the past developed separately (e.g., nonlinear dynamics of aerospace and underwater vehicles), but that have many problems in common. "

Nilsson is examining what these vesicles do and exactly how these lipid droplets are consumed. He is also studying how stored fat cells can be converted into heat, as well as how to determine genetic dispositions for obesity.

For example, you can use the words “I should apologize” to convey your intention to apologize. But if you emphasize “I” with a rising intonation that expresses incredulity, those same words could instead convey your reluctance to apologize, and belief that someone else should. Our choice of emphasis and intonation—the so-called “prosody” of what we say—is an important but understudied part of what we encode in our speech. For example, the prosody of a sentence often reflects what is new information in a conversation versus what is established background. Prosody also reveals aspects of the sentence’s structure, namely how the words group syntactically and relate semantically. Using an appropriate prosody makes it substantially easier to understand a sentence; using the wrong one can create confusion. As Canada Research Chair in Speech and Language Processing, Dr. Michael Wagner is trying to determine how prosody works by integrating insights from different research fields. In particular, he uses production and perception experiments in an attempt to answer two key questions: What information is reflected in the prosody of a phrase or sentence, and how much of this information is retrieved by the listener and used in speech processing? By using sentence prosody as a window into how we process language, Wagner’s research will deepen our understanding of human language. It also has potential implications in language instruction, speech therapy, synthesized speech and speech-recognition systems. "

However, ask them to cut a straight line or move a given distance and they perform worse than a human with a ruler. While good at repeatability, robots are poor in absolute accuracy.Yet, many advanced applications require absolute accuracy. This is especially true in machining and imagery-guided automated surgery, where robots need to attain thousands of calculated—as opposed to taught—positions.Dr. Ilian Bonev, Canada Research Chair in Precision Robotics, is developing robot designs and methods for evaluating and increasing their absolute accuracy.

Even so, disease agents that cause persistent infections like tuberculosis and HIV have developed new ways to bypass immune defences and reduce the effectiveness of vaccines.As persistent infections remain a major challenge, controlling them requires new therapeutic approaches to disrupt these evasions while enhancing immune defences. In his role as Canada Research Chair in Neonatal Mucosal Immunology, Dr. Philip Griebel is looking at immune defences in the small intestine of newborns. The intestine’s mucous membranes provide the first barrier to infection, with its immune cells the first to respond to any invasion. This response decides whether the disease agents are eliminated or become successful in establishing a persistent infection. Through his research, Griebel found out that mucosal (mucous membrane) immune cells in newborns have a much greater ability to respond to vaccination than was previously thought. He is building on this knowledge to see if immunotherapeutic strategies can be developed to prevent persistent infection by disease agents. To this end, his research calls for developing unique animal models and research tools to analyze the molecular workings of immune evasion. Mucosal surfaces throughout the body serve as a point of entry for a wide variety of disease agents. Since these surfaces also share common defence mechanisms, developing immunotherapeutic strategies to prevent infection in the small intestine will have broad use in preventing disease agents seeking refuge at other sites in the body.

Blaser’s studies build on insights gained through research and collaboration with colleagues and Aboriginal leaders from North and South America. Conflicts about conceptions of reality are central to his research into the difficulties Aboriginals face when trying to express and pursue their visions of a good life. In contrast to development, Aboriginal visions of the good life are grounded in the historical, ecological and spiritual experiences of peoples in particular places. Blaser’s research with Aboriginal communities explores these “life projects” as well as the obstacles that cultural differences pose to pursuing them. "

",The research aims to advance our scientific understanding of the recovery from traumatic brain injury and to minimize its harmful cognitive impacts. ,Inside an Injured Brain," Inside an Injured Brain Traumatic brain injury is the leading cause of disability in people under the age of 40. The resulting cognitive and emotional disturbances are often permanent, with debilitating consequences for family, work and academic life.There are few effective treatments available to help people affected by these injuries. Dr. Robin Green, Canada Research Chair in Traumatic Brain Injury—Cognitive Rehabilitation Neuroscience, hopes to change this. She suggests that our lack of effective treatment is due partly to a limited understanding of how we recover from serious brain injury. Her research is wide-ranging, with an emphasis on potential barriers to recovery. Green is focusing on three hypotheses in particular. First, that due to the finite resources in the brain available to support recovery, there is competition between recovering cognitive and motor functions, resulting in a trade-off between them. For example, recovering the ability to walk might impede recovery of memory function. Second, that for some, the cognitive and neural effects of brain injury worsen during the chronic stages of the injury. In other words, that damage increases with time. And third, that certain types of damaged brain cells, which can remain in the brain long after injury, can actively impede recovery.Based on her findings, Green is working on approaches to improve recovery, including increasing therapy hours at different recovery stages; targeted early therapies for brain areas at risk of subacute atrophy (somewhat rapid deterioration); and customized therapy based on individual risk factors.

The forms we use daily— powering not just personal computers, but also websites and financial and medical systems — represent millions of lines of source code and millennia of human effort. But this software also comes with a terrible burden of legacy. These systems often contain bugs that lead to security issues such as the loss of personal information, and stability problems that can cause crashes in everything from e-commerce sites to power plants.Dr. Andrew Warfield, Canada Research Chair in Systems and Security, is developing innovative, practical approaches to improving software. The techniques developed by his team recognize that existing software systems are too complex and entrenched to be completely rewritten. Instead, the group works to improve systems from the outside.Warfield’s work on the Remus high-availability project demonstrated that advanced software techniques, previously used to protect banking and medical systems from failures, could be provided seamlessly below existing applications, allowing their state to be mirrored to a second computer. Applications can then survive common forms of hardware failures completely transparently, with no modifications to existing software and without even losing a network connection.Warfield’s research group is currently working to help developers better understand how their software behaves. His team has developed a framework that collects detailed recordings of running applications, which can then be analyzed and presented back to developers to help fix problems.Warfield’s work promises to make existing systems more stable and secure, and provide developers with better tools to build new software.

One of the central puzzles in neuroscience is how a brain containing hundreds of billions of neurons, and tens of thousands of times more synaptic connections, wires up with precision.Dr. Brian Chen, Canada Research Chair in Neural Circuit Formation, is examining how neurons make synaptic partnering decisions to form functioning neural circuits. The instructions on how to build a brain are essentially written in the genome. Chen’s research involves deciphering the rules governing neural circuit formation, and uncovering molecules used to guide neurons into the circuits that underlie a behaviour.To uncover the different molecules and strategies used to assemble neural circuits, Chen combines high-resolution imaging techniques with advanced molecular genetics. Using these tools, he can look inside living animals while their neurons are making connections to determine why and how they make particular connection decisions. To identify the underlying genetic mechanisms, Chen uses invertebrate model systems, and applies his discoveries to human health using vertebrate model systems.Chen’s research will provide insights into how the brain is built from the genetic code, and how these instructions can go awry in mental retardation and disorders such as schizophrenia and autism.

At one time, native peoples controlled the land that made up the greater part of the North American continent. Neither they nor the Europeans who displaced them considered land ownership as absolute and individual.Dr. Allan Greer, Canada Research Chair in Colonial North America, offers perspectives of the past in his studies of land tenure in the Early Modern period of the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries.In looking at these fundamental issues, he examines the various native forms of territorial possession, as well as the customs and legal systems imported by Spanish, English and French colonizers. In doing so, Greer is trying to gain a fuller understanding of the processes by which modern versions of property eventually emerged in North America.The French introduced seigneurial tenure in Canada, while the Spanish emphasized open-range ranching in Mexico. The English, meanwhile, relied on the formalities of treaties and purchase to gain control of native lands.As they went, those establishing colonies across the continent developed more precise and exclusive forms of property as they confronted native inhabitants with new techniques for surveying, mapping and registering lands.Greer’s research outlines these important historical issues, which provide a valuable background in understanding current questions of Aboriginal title, environmental regulation and property rights.

",Exposing the Keys to Brain Development," Exposing the Keys to Brain Development Over the last thirty years, researchers have discovered that brain development in humans and a variety of animal species depends on two things: pre-programmed developmental events, and the environment encountered during postnatal development. This is especially true in the visual system. Research studying the visual systems of different species has illustrated that if eyes are given unequal exposure during their postnatal period of development, then the strength of the respective developing neural pathways will be altered forever. For example, under normal conditions, both eyes develop equal functional connections with the cortex. But when one eye is covered to prevent its use, even for as little as three hours during the critical period of early life, it develops a weaker than normal functional connection with the cortex, while the uncovered eye forms a stronger than usual bond. The diminished connection creates irreversible, lower vision capacity in the weakened eye. Conversely, similar exposure in adult animals has no effect on their cortical connections or visual capabilities. As Senior Chair in Brain Development, Dr. Max Cynader is committed to advancing understanding of the neural processes that contribute to phenomena like these. He also seeks to uncover the molecular mechanisms that trigger such occurrences during the critical periods in postnatal development of young animals but prevent them in adults. Along with his formidable team, Dr. Cynader is developing state-of-the-art brain imaging techniques, novel uses of gene microarrays, innovative bioinformatics tools, and cutting edge software to achieve his objectives. Having led neuroscience research in Canada for more than twenty-five years, Dr. Cynader is ideally suited for his new position. Despite rapid change in this evolving field, he remains one of the top contributors, and holds an international reputation for award-winning research. The outcomes of his latest endeavors will prove invaluable to neuroscientists, and to research and development in key areas such as genetics, health and human development. "

Using microfluidics (the manipulation of tiny amounts of fluid, usually contained in a space smaller than a millimetre), the technology would let users run multiple biomedical and chemical tests from one hand-held device. Dr. Carolyn Ren, Canada Research Chair in Lab-on-a-Chip Technology, is working to make this technology a reality. She is leading a team with a blend of expertise in physics, biochemistry and a broad range of engineering fields undertaking research to better understand “microfluidic transport phenomena,” and the processes to which they lead. Understanding these phenomena will help researchers design and improve lab-on-a-chip tools. Technology resulting from Ren’s research could be used in tools such as microfluidic-based devices for multidimensional protein separation and identification—techniques used to diagnose diseases based on the presence of biological markers. Ren’s lab is also developing microfluidic platforms for cell culture and living cell analysis—essential for on-the-spot diagnosis.

",Analytical Chemistry Leaves the Lab ," Analytical Chemistry Leaves the Lab To do chemical analyses, researchers currently need to go to the sample, transport it to a laboratory and then perform their analysis. As Canada Research Chair in New Analytical Methods and Technologies, Dr. Janusz Pawliszyn wants to revolutionize sample collection by developing accurate, precise, on-site devices that move analytical chemistry out of the lab and allow researchers to complete their analyses right where the system to be investigated is located. For example, researchers could characterize a person’s blood composition using a micro-probe to do a selective intravenous extraction of very small quantities in a targeted area. Replacing the need for needles in collecting blood for analysis, such technology would make samples easier, faster and safer to gather.Such micro-analytical technologies combined with a wireless communication system would also provide immediate information about a patient’s health status. Such systems could also be used to better monitor, investigate and correct the impact of environmental conditions and food supply on human and animal health. Through his lab, InFAReL, Pawliszyn’s research team is also developing joint research projects with partners in industry and health care.Pawliszyn has already developed several well-integrated sampling and sample-preparation technologies, including Solid Phase Microextraction, recognized by the analytical community as one of the six greatest analytical inventions of the last decade. As Chair, he has already expanded this research towards analyses carried out where the sample naturally occurs, including within the human body and other living organisms.Pawliszyn believes that on-site analysis will help both eliminate errors and reduce the time between sample collection and analysis.

Dr. Frank Sicheri is looking inside human cells to discover what switches a disease on, and, ultimately, how to switch it back off. The human genome houses some 500 “protein kinases.” These molecules act as switches inside cells. The switches regulate various biological processes—from breathing to eating and digesting. When genes inside the cell become mutated, however, the protein kinases start to function abnormally. These abnormalities, in turn, lead to the cellular dysfunctions that cause many of the diseases humans can face, such as cancer. So, the more we know about protein kinases, the more we can learn about disease.To date, researchers have only investigated a small fraction of the protein kinases encoded in the human genome in great detail. As Canada Research Chair in Structural Principles of Signal Transduction, Sicheri will study more of the protein kinases in the human genome. Sicheri’s research is aimed at furthering our understanding about protein kinase regulation. He is particularly focused on understanding the underlying structural mechanism responsible for “signalling function,” or how these proteins talk to one another. Sicheri’s long-term goal is to use new knowledge about protein kinases and associated systems to develop drugs to treat human diseases, including various types of cancer. "

As Canada Research Chair in Obesity, Dr. Tony Lam is looking at the variousmechanisms in the brain’s central nervous system that maybe involved in this progression.Lam is looking at the part of the brain known as thehypothalamus. The hypothalamus has received significant attention in recent diabetes and obesity research because of its ability to detect rises in hormones that regulate food intake, body weight and glucose levels. In obese individuals and those with diabetes, these central nervous system-sensing mechanisms are disrupted, leading to an increase in blood glucose levels and body weight. Lam will examine these processes by studying nutrient-sensing mechanisms in the brain that regulate the body’s balance of glucose and energy.Understanding the processes involved in obesity can offer us insights into how the central nervous system reacts to high-fat-induced obesity.

A promising solution to these problems and others is to capitalize on the amazing properties of nanoscopic materials. But to make the most of these materials, which are smaller than a billionth of a meter, it’s essential to resolve some processing and manufacturing challenges—particularly in terms of using nanoscopic properties at the industrial scale and developing a truly 3D production method. 3D printing—which turns 3D digital models into physical objects—has the potential to change the way we make everything from food and toys to complex aircraft components.

While some of the questions they probe have been pondered for generations, the solutions to these problems, and the number theory related to these problems, have important applications in contemporary technology. Without number theory, for example, electronic commerce would not be a reality, since information technology relies on the secure and efficient transmission of data, and this transmission relies on the theory of numbers. Mathematicians use techniques from geometry to construct “transmission error-correcting codes”—codes to ensure data arrives as it was sent. Mathematical ideas like characters, exponential sums, recurrence sequences and notions of uniform distribution, meanwhile, are used in designing advanced cryptographic (or code) systems to ensure the security of transmitted data. Dr. Cameron Stewart, Canada Research Chair in Number Theory, is one of Canada's leading number theorists. His work in areas such as combinatorial number theory, Diophantine approximation and Diophantine equations—all of which are central topics in number theory—is recognized around the world.

One of the most basic and challenging riddles Otto faces is why life is so remarkably diverse at every level—from the way species look on the surface, right down to how their genomes are organized. She has shown, for instance, that evolution favours “reduced” genomes in parasites because this simplicity helps parasites evade recognition. But the reverse holds true for hosts, for whom “duplicated” genomes improve their ability to recognize and eliminate different types of parasites. This information could be extremely useful in fighting parasites that cause diseases such as malaria and the sexually transmitted disease trichomoniasis.Otto’s research group has also established a statistical foundation to determine whether a species’ particular trait is common because it promotes the formation of new species, decreases the risk of extinction, or is just persistent and unlikely to change. Otto’s current research is turning to the puzzles of adaptation. Looking at plants and yeast, she is examining the limits of a species’ ability to adapt to environmental challenges, and how much of the genome contributes to this adaptation.The results of Otto’s work provide insight into how and why the world’s species have become so diverse, and helps build a more solid foundation for understanding how species will be able to adapt to environmental changes in the future.

As a result, they are increasingly being used in the transportation industry, especially in the aeronautic and automotive sectors. As Canada Research Chair in High Performance Composites, Dr. François Trochu has studied techniques to manufacture composites through resin transfer molding—that is, the injection of a reactive polymer into a closed and rigid mould reinforced with long glass or carbon fibres. High-performance composites are traditionally made in an autoclave using fibre reinforcement that has been pre impregnated with resin. Since this technology is very costly, Trochu has strived to develop new manufacturing methods using flexible injection into a mould containing a deformable inner surface, so as to speed up the flow of resin and thereby shorten the manufacturing cycle. His research has already led to the development of a new flexible injection process called Polyflex. This patent-pending technology makes it possible to manufacture high-quality composite parts up to 35 times faster than with the usual rigid injection method. After being certified for use with aeronautical-class resins injected through three-dimensional woven carbon reinforcements, the Polyflex technology is now starting to be applied in the aeronautics industry for manufacturing composite structural parts.

One tendency is to be dismissive—the argument being that an authoritarian regime such as China’s cannot possess a true judicial system. The more optimistic view sees signs of an emerging Western-style judiciary in the country. Which position is the reality in China? This is the question that Dr. Hélène Piquet, Canada Research Chair in Chinese Law and Globalization, aims to answer. Recent developments in China have revealed increasing control of the judicial system and society at large by the Chinese Communist Party. Still, Piquet believes we must be careful not to view Chinese society and the Chinese judicial system as static. Even though Chinese authorities reject the idea of an independent judiciary, several recent provisions tabled by the Supreme People’s Court aim to make justice more accessible. As well, reforms to environmental protection laws show that China is taking significant note of western and international ideas. This is also true for women’s rights. By studying these diverse facets of Chinese law, Piquet hopes to demonstrate the dynamic relationship between the law, the political system, and Chinese culture, especially in light of current and future judicial developments.

Governance by indicators, evaluation and accountability is not a universal model whose effects on education quality, school equity and teacher professionalism have been positive wherever it has been applied. Maroy’s research seeks to understand how different societies apply this new governance model, and to analyze both its expected and unforeseen effects by comparing education systems in Canada and Europe.Further, Maroy is doing a comparative analysis of how new policies are viewed and understood in educational institutions in Québec and the rest of Canada. Technical and organizational sociology shows that evaluation and accountability tools do not have the same results everywhere, because they are used and adapted in ways that depend on how they are perceived by local stakeholders. What are the cognitive, normative and social factors affecting how evaluation and accountability tools are viewed locally?

However, research led by Dr. Reuven Gordon, Canada Research Chair in Nanoplasmonics, is finding ways to “squeeze” light to see more at the nanoscale (the invisible molecular level). His research aims to make improvements in a range of fields, from health (detecting cancers early on and improving viral research) to energy (advancing solar energy technology).Under a microscope, human cells can be seen with the naked eye. However, viruses or cancer markers are invisible because they are much smaller than the wavelength of light. To see them, light has to be squeezed down to the nanometre (one billionth of a metre). Gordon is using “nanoplasmonics“—manipulating light using pieces of metal measured in nanometres—to literally shrink light.Gordon has pioneered the development of sensors for the early detection of cancers. But more sensitive detectors are needed, and he is currently leading research into new approaches to achieve the desired sensitivity.Gordon and collaborators in Spain have already demonstrated the ability of light to grab particles the size of viruses. Their exciting new method uses record-breaking low optical powers to prevent damage to the particles, and has great potential to expand the toolbox of methods for studying viruses. Gordon is also researching ways to make solar energy conversion more efficient. This research has the potential to produce less expensive solar panels to help meet the world’s energy needs in an environmentally friendly way. "

Contests, tournaments and other competitions are important parts of everyday life. Firms race to be the first to develop and market new products, lobbyists battle to have decision-makers adopt their point of view, and graduates compete for jobs. Contests are often regulated to promote equity, fairness or other worthwhile objectives. Examples of this kind of regulation have included affirmative action in the labour market, or preferential treatment of domestic firms in public procurement. During the infamous negotiations between NHL owners and the NHL Players’ Association that led to the loss of the 2004-05 hockey season, NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman advocated cost controls, such as a salary cap, to improve the “competitive balance” in the league. Dr. René Kirkegaard, Canada Research Chair in Risk Management and Regulation, will use tools from the field of game theory to perform a systematic analysis of different types of regulation in contests and competitions.Contests are often very complicated games. Competitors have different strengths and weaknesses, and they are usually less than perfectly informed about the skills of their rivals. Given these many layers of difference and uncertainty, predicting the effects of complicated regulation can be a difficult task. Not only will Kirkegaard’s research contribute to our understanding of the intricate strategic considerations that come into play when the rules of the game are altered, but it may ultimately also inform public policy in a variety of areas.

This question is called the congruent number problem. This simply stated problem turns out to be related to modern arithmetic geometry and the deep Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture for elliptic curves. Iwasawa theory is a framework for attacking this conjecture in a systematic way. Although a full answer to the mathematical questions surrounding the conjecture is still far off, Iwasawa theory itself has been growing and spawning other areas of mathematical research. The youngest of these areas is the non-commutative Iwasawa theory that Canada Research Chair in Mathematics Dr. Sujatha Ramdorai and her team are studying. Their research aims to explore this fledgling area in-depth, and to glean other insights into the theory of rational points of elliptic curves, giving us not only a better understanding of some of the fundamental ongoing questions in geometry, but a richer understanding of how certain parts of the mathematical world are constructed.

between genotypes and phenotypes.",This research will lead to a better understanding of molecular complexity and protein function.,Connecting the Dots Between Genes and Traits," Connecting the Dots Between Genes and Traits Genetics permeates our modern culture. From grade school, students now understand the fundamentals of molecular genetics—that physical characters, from the colour of our eyes to the shape of a pea, are determined by packets of information we call “genes.” Many even know that genes are made up of DNA, that differences between gene copies—“alleles”—make up an organism’s “genotype”, and that the characteristics they lead to are called “phenotypes.” Surprisingly, though, we still do not really understand how genotypes and phenotypes are connected. Several different projects in the laboratory of Dr. Thomas Merritt, Canada Research Chair in Genomics and Bioinformatics, are investigating this connection by looking at different organisms, from microbes to fruit flies to fish. Merritt’s research explores biological diversity and its underlying genetic architecture by combining bioinformatics—the computer-based examination of gene, genotype and genome (all the genes in an organism)—with functional genomics, or direct manipulation and experimentation. In one project, student researchers are using genetically engineered fruit flies to investigate how their metabolism affects things such as how long they live and how much fat they store. In another project, Merritt’s team is looking at the genome of an entire community of microbes able to thrive in contaminated mine waste, in the hopes of understanding the community’s metabolic potential. Knowing that genetic interactions are complex and sometimes counterintuitive, Merritt’s team is developing a better understanding of molecular complexity and protein function in order to tackle a wide range of challenges, from metabolic disease to biological stress to industrial waste clean-up.

Now, research in Canada using rare isotopes is deepening our understanding of how chemical elements—the ashes of ancient stars of which we are all made—are produced.Only the lightest elements—hydrogen, helium and lithium—were present in the early universe. All heavier elements, including the raw materials for life itself, were, and are, made through nuclear reactions in stars and are spread throughout the cosmos in explosive astrophysical events. Many of the short-lived radioactive isotopes involved in these reactions have never been studied in laboratories, however, and their properties are still unknown.As Canada Research Chair in Gamma-Ray Spectroscopy and Rare Isotope Physics, Dr. Carl Svensson is leading the development of advanced new spectrometers that measure the high-frequency light, or gamma rays, emitted by these rare isotopes. These spectrometers will allow researchers to determine the isotopes’ structural properties, and to understand their role in producing the elements. Svensson’s team is also using the same technology to search for new forces of nature that would help explain the imbalance between matter and anti-matter in the universe.Answers from Svensson’s research will provide new insights into the origins of the chemical elements that make up everything around us. The results may transform our most basic understanding of the origins of matter in the universe. "

",Bird Brains and Spatial Degeneration," Bird Brains and Spatial Degeneration We know that all species that move need to orient themselves within their surroundings before they can find their way. But surprisingly, we know little about how this happens. Studies have shown that features like trees or buildings—and geometry, as in distance and direction—play fundamental roles. In fact, all species studied to date have shown what researchers call “an obligatory encoding of geometry.” But does the type or amount of geometry encoded by the brain change over a lifespan? Research has shown that aging affects how the left and right sides of the brain work to complete tasks. As people age, their cognitive abilities decline, including their ability to orient themselves when moving around. Yet most research on this issue is limited to studies of stationary participants. As Canada Research Chair in Comparative Cognition, Dr. Debbie Kelly is examining the effects of aging on “hemispheric asymmetries” (relative functional differences between the left and right sides of the brain) using tasks we do every day. To do this, she is studying brain function in birds. Birds’ brains work similarly to those of humans in that they use different hemispheres to perform different tasks. In fact, it is easier to examine the two brain hemispheres independently of each other in birds than in humans. Kelly will learn how aging and ecology influence how birds encode and weigh spatial cues, and how the two brain hemispheres process that information. Ultimately, her research will combine the data she obtains from humans and animals to better understand spatial cognition, and may lead to developing a useful tool for the early detection of spatial degeneration disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease.

The X chromosome inherited from each parent is silenced in 50 per cent of females cells, i.e. 50 per cent of female cells have an active X chromosome of maternal origin and 50 per cent have an active X chromosome of paternal origin. This process is memorized so that it is heritable through subsequent rounds of cell division. Dr. Alan Spatz, Canada Research Chair in Molecular Pathology, hypothesized that a gene defect would have a different impact on tumour growth depending on whether it affects the active or the inactive X chromosome of a cell. In cutaneous melanoma—the most lethal cancer of the skin—Spatz showed that melanomas in females who died of the disease more frequently have losses on the active X chromosome than melanomas in females who had good clinical outcome. This hypothesis has also been validated in several other types of cancer.Spatz’s research seeks to gain better insight into the role of the X-chromosome inactivation during the progression of cancers, to study the biological function and regulation of tumour-suppressor genes located on the X chromosome and to identify new X-chromosome-related targets for cancer treatment.Dr. Alan Spatz’s research on the X-chromosome genetics could open up a new avenue in cancer therapy by identifying new pathways of cancer progression and new therapeutic targets. It is expected that this innovative approach will lead to significant improvements in patient health and treatments that are better adapted to each person. "

Or is she perpetuating one of the many stereotypes keeping women and minorities from professional advancement?Dr. Toni Schmader is uncovering how cultural stereotypes set up psychological roadblocks that impair how people process information. As Canada Research Chair in Social Psychology, Schmader is working with a theory called “stereotype threat,” which states that merely being aware that negative stereotypes exist and might be applied to you creates a mental burden that can impair your performance. Because the risk of being reduced to a negative stereotype is much lower for men or majority-group members, the systematic differences in test scores that result from stereotype threat can make it look like there are group differences in intellectual ability.Schmader and her team are conducting experiments to reveal, dissect and dismantle these effects. In one study, women performed worse than men in solving a set of math problems when they believed their math skills were being diagnosed. However, they performed just as well as their male peers when the job was framed as a simple problem-solving exercise. Other research by Schmader has revealed that people’s performance suffers, in part, because they are busy spending mental effort on suppressing anxiety and self-doubt.Schmader’s research will shed light on inventions, policies and personal coping strategies that might eradicate stereotypes and empower people to perform to their full potential.

High-density urban populations, current farming practices, and rapid climate change are major factors that have led both old and new viruses to emerge and spread. Dr. Marc-André Langlois, Canada Research Chair in Molecular Virology and Intrinsic Immunity, is exploring ways to fight and prevent these infections. Retroviruses that spread from animals to people pose a unique threat, because they permanently insert themselves into the genetic code of the cells they infect and interfere with the cells’ normal functions, causing disease. HIV is probably the best-known example of a harmful retrovirus that has jumped from animals to humans. But scientists have also isolated mouse retroviruses in the tissues of patients suffering from liver disease and breast cancer. Because all mammals—including domestic and farm animals—harbor numerous retroviruses, scientists are interested in finding out if and how these retroviruses affect human health, and what immune defenses are available to protect us. Langlois is examining how certain proteins in our immune system—called APOBEC3— protect us against retroviruses. These proteins can stop retroviruses from replicating by mutating their DNA, permanently inactivating them. However, to protect themselves, over time these retroviruses have developed countermeasures against the APOBEC3 proteins. Langlois and his research team are studying how host and virus defense mechanisms interact. This research could change the way certain diseases are treated, and lead to new strategies for fighting and preventing retroviral infections. "

The diagnosis of prostate cancer has particularly great potential to benefit from advancements in medical imaging techniques. Prostate cancer is the second-leading cancer-related cause of death in men. Each year, about 240,000 new cases are diagnosed in North America, with about 31,000 dying from the disease. To definitively diagnose prostate cancer, patients need to undergo a needle biopsy, typically guided by ultrasound imaging. Because of poor image quality, the biopsy is currently performed “blind.” Recent innovations by Dr. Purang Abolmaesumi, Canada Research Chair in Biomedical Engineering, help identify cancerous tissue using ultrasound data in a way that has not been possible until now. The technique aims to analyze tiny variations in the ultrasound data that show differences between cancerous and normal tissue. Abolmaesumi will use the results of this analysis to develop a “spotlight” highlighting cancerous regions during biopsies. This will provide more effective patient treatment and reduce the need for painful biopsy procedures. Abolmaesumi’s work also aims to enable affordable, real-time, safe and continuous monitoring of the anatomy during surgical operations—something currently only possible using ionizing radiation, such as X-rays, or very expensive magnetic resonance imaging equipment.

Nitrogen fixation is the process by which nitrogen enters natural environments. This process, which influences plant growth and carbon exchanges in ecosystems, depends on nitrogenase, an enzyme found in certain single-cell organisms living in the soil or in symbiosis with plants. To do its work properly, nitrogenase needs micronutrients (metals) present in the soil. However, these micronutrients vary considerably in quantity and diversity. In soils in which many organisms are in competition for limited resources, metallophores—molecules produced by many organisms capable of influencing the availability of micronutrients—could be key factors in controlling the dynamics of micronutrients and thus the nitrogen cycle. Dr. Jean-Philippe Bellenger, Canada Research Chair in Terrestrial Biogeochemistry, seeks to better understand the nitrogen cycle by elucidating the role played by metallophores. Using modern methods from analytical chemistry and molecular biology, he will study the importance and role of metallophores in the absorption of micronutrients by nitrogen-fixing organisms. His research will cast new light on the links between the availability of micronutrients at the molecular level and nitrogen fixation at the ecosystem level. Further, Bellenger will develop new analytical techniques making it possible to more easily assess nitrogen fixation. These highly sensitive, real-time measuring techniques will enable us to better account for nitrogen fixation variations in space and time, and will help strengthen our ability to manage our natural resources and put in place appropriate policies for meeting the challenges of global change.

Although these ecosystems are distant from direct sources of contamination, they are affected by rising temperatures due to climate change and the circulation of pollution in the atmosphere, such as mercury. Mercury concentrations in some northern fish are among the highest in the country, even though local mercury levels are extremely low. This is due to a number of interacting factors, including the type of soils, forests and wetlands in watersheds, water chemistry and temperature, and properties of the lake food chain.

The governments of all developed countries are looking for strategies that will enable them to get a better return on the resources they invest in their health systems. Research on care organization and health policy is a key element of efforts to improve the functioning, adaptation and performance of health systems. The work of Dr. Jean-Louis Denis, Canada Research Chair in Governance and Transformation of Health Organizations and Systems, will focus on the impact of new organizational methods (e.g., health-care networks) on patient care. Denis points out that putting networks in place involves challenges in terms of governance, change management, and co-ordination of the activities of different professional groups and associations. Denis will also examine strategies that governments can adopt to help health system managers and professionals better deal with the challenges they face. He will seek to determine the strategies and skills that promote greater consistency in policies and decisions adopted at the national, regional and local levels of the health system. Further, he will give particular attention to identifying strategies that promote the use of available scientific knowledge to improve the health system. "

They have also started to ask who should bear the responsibility for global justice. The “recipients” of global justice, however, are not usually part of these discussions. Those for whom global justice is designed, and in whose name it is defended, are often thought of only as ideas, along with their needs and their interests. They are viewed as needy people deserving assistance, not participants actively engaged in the process of defining and defending their needs. Treating them more as passive subjects than active agents of global justice, though, has far-reaching consequences for the shape and content of ideas around global justice. Dr. Monique Deveaux, Canada Research Chair in Ethics and Global Social Change (Social and Political Philosophy), is addressing this gap in philosophical writing on global justice by asking key questions about how inequality and poverty problems are framed, and by reframing our understanding of these issues The result will be a new approach for understanding and arguing for global economic redistribution. Drawing on the insights of development ethicists—who argue that empowerment and democracy are pivotal for social economic development—and writings by feminist and postcolonial theorists, Deveaux ultimately aims to develop a more inclusive ethics of global justice.

The characterization of soil contamination (that is, evaluation of the nature, extent and mobility of the contamination) is one of the key components of the remediation process. However, at present there is no accepted way of determining the representativeness of samples collected (the extent to which they have the same characteristics as the rest of the contaminated site) or of contaminant concentrations measured during characterization studies. This results in inaccurate characterization data, which can cause delays in remediation, as well as economic and social losses amounting to tens or even hundreds of billions of dollars worldwide. As Canada Research Chair in Characterization of Contaminated Sites, Dr. Jean-Sébastien Dubé will develop a new method of characterizing contaminated sites, ensuring strict monitoring and control of sample representativeness. To do this, he will draw on mathematical models, with the aim of quantifying the representativeness of the extent of contamination, as well as of contaminant concentrations measured in each sample. He will also develop new collection methods to ensure sample representativeness throughout the remediation process. Dubé’s research will make it possible to achieve a more accurate understanding of site contamination and the risk it represents. The research will undoubtedly have a positive effect on Canadians’ quality of life, since if contaminated sites are revitalized more quickly and effectively, the resulting economic benefits will be greater, as will the social, environmental and public health benefits for city dwellers.

During this time, we will also have to face unprecedented climatic change and an economic transformation in many parts of the globe. Feeding us, without irreparably damaging the world’s ecosystems, will therefore be one of the great human security challenges of the 21st century. Current patterns of food production and consumption cannot be maintained. There are no simple answers, and although the best disciplinary research is necessary, we must also break apart the intellectual and institutional barriers that traditionally separate academics, policy-makers and activists. To meet this challenge, Dr. Evan Fraser, Canada Research Chair in Global Food Security, will focus on two key issues. First, he aims to learn from past food security crises in order to understand where the world might be vulnerable today. To do this, he will integrate knowledge from nutrition, sociology, political science, geography, international development and psychology with knowledge from biotechnology, crop science, hydrology, agricultural economics and soil science. Fraser will use this combined knowledge to critically explore ways of ensuring we both have enough food to eat and that it is nutritious and adequately distributed. Second, Fraser will explore the socio-economic forces that shape our food-producing landscapes, thus trying to determine what regions of the world are likely to be vulnerable to food insecurity in the 21st century.

Diabetes now accounts for almost half of kidney failure and a third of heart failure hospitalizations in Canada. Despite growing recognition of the high prevalence of kidney and heart failure among diabetic patients, treatment has changed little in almost 20 years.As Canada Research Chair in Diabetes Complications, Dr. Richard E. Gilbert will explore the potential of new drug-based, biological and progenitor cell treatments for kidney and heart disease in diabetes.Even though diabetes is a disease that affects a number of different organs, traditional treatment approaches often focus on single organs. In addition, there has also been a sharp divide between the researchers doing theoretical research and those performing clinical research. Gilbert plans to not only explore common mechanisms and treatments across multiple organ systems, but also to bridge the gap between theory and clinical practice by drawing from his experience in epidemiology, pharmacology, cell biology and molecular biology. This integrated approach is already proving successful with new drug- and cell-based treatments targeting fibrosis, a key mechanism in the development of kidney and heart disease in diabetes.There is no better time than the present to address the desperate need to find remedies for cardio-renal disease in diabetes. Through Gilbert’s research, Canadians will have new therapies for the treatment, prevention—and possibly even the reversal—of the complications of diabetes. "

These diseases can quickly hit large sections of the population, sending many to hospital, causing death, and placing a heavy burden on the economy. So far, the most effective ways to fight viral infections have relied on the immune system’s inherent ability to eliminate viruses. As Canada Research Chair in Viral Immunity and Pathogenesis, Dr. S.M. Mansour Haeryfar will study a specialized subset of immune cells called cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs). These cells recognize virus-infected cells and eliminate them by using an impressive arsenal of lethal molecules. Despite their presence in many people infected with disease-causing viruses, CTLs may not always be able to rid the body of these viruses. In addition to being under tight control by various other types of cells found in the body, CTLs often attack only a very limited range of viral targets.Haeryfar’s research team aims, among other goals, to understand the limitations of CTL responses, and to design new therapies that enhance CTL-based antiviral immunity. Haeryfar’s research will better our understanding of the body’s immune responses to viruses, and will lead to the development of highly effective strategies for designing new vaccines and treating infectious diseases.

Everyone needs an adequate intake of B-vitamins to prevent disease throughout each stage of their life—from embryo to elderly. But what level is adequate? It has been shown that adequate levels of vitamins help reduce the occurrence of chronic disease. Lower levels of B-vitamins have been associated with an increased risk of pregnancy complications, cancer, heart disease and diabetes. On the other hand, high intakes of fortified foods and supplements have made it possible for people to ingest too much B-vitamins, which may create imbalances with other nutrients. Dr. Yvonne Lamers, Canada Research Chair in Human Nutrition and Vitamin Metabolism, is using kinetic studies to contribute new knowledge about B-vitamin adequacy among Canadians. Kinetic studies are innovative, unique research methods that evaluate the consequences of different levels of nutrients to people’s metabolism in efforts to define what is an adequate level. The key goal of Lamers’s research program is to uncover the metabolic consequences of less than optimal vitamin B-12 intake and high folic acid intake in humans. Lamers’s research will help determine some of the underlying connections between nutrition and disease. Her resulting recommendations will also feed into a review of current public health policies related to nutrient intake.

Although this land-lake coupling occurs naturally, it is especially emphasized in areas that have been subjected to forest harvesting, permafrost thawing and other changes in the watershed. The research will take place in boreal Quebec along a gradient from southern coniferous forest to the northern limit of the boreal forest. Coniferous forests have strong carbon inputs due to the densely vegetated catchments while in the forest-tundra zone in northern Quebec the trees are small and restricted and to distantly spaced patches where carbon inputs are at a minimum, yet the landscape is subjected to changes from climate warming.The research of Dr. Milla Rautio, Canada Research Chair in Boreal Aquatic Ecology, will lead to a completely revised understanding of the structure and functioning of boreal lakes.

Hundreds of millions of tonnes of waste are generated annually. Until we eliminate the need for waste-disposal sites, we must find safe ways to dispose of it.We most commonly think of waste when we put out the trash and recycling for collection. But where does it go? Also, what about more dangerous types of waste, like waste that comes from energy generation or mining of resources like gold or uranium? Ultimately, waste finds its way to a site where it lies on or beneath the ground, where it can contaminate surface and ground water. Dr. Kerry Rowe, Canada Research Chair in Geotechnical and Geoenvironmental Engineering, addresses this need for a wide range of wastes, including municipal, industrial, hazardous, nuclear and mine waste. His research focuses on the measures in place in waste-disposal sites to ensure environmental protection, recognizing that some of them can, and will, fail at some time. Rowe examines both geotechnical and geoenvironmental aspects of the environmental protection systems in waste-disposal sites, including covers, systems to collect garbage fluids, and liners. Irrespective of whether the materials used are natural (e.g., soils, such as gravel) or manmade (e.g., plastics), his research is addressing the question of how long it will last and what happens if it fails. With his research, Rowe hopes to answer the need to develop cost-effective techniques to safely dispose of waste, as well as guidelines and regulations that will provide long-term protection of the environment.

It has been shown that inflammation plays an important role in the development of cardiovascular and neoplastic diseases. As Canada Research Chair in Inflammatory Response Signaling, Dr. Marc Servant is studying specific proteins (kinases and ubiquitin ligases) that regulate innate immune response to diseases such as atherosclerosis and cancer, and cause inflammatory reactions. Servant’s research combines cell biology, molecular biology, pharmacology, immunology and genetics. With the help of state-of-the-art cell biology techniques and equipment, he aims to identify new cellular targets for treating chronic inflammatory diseases, and to propose new therapy approaches.

According to Dr. J. Kevin Shoemaker, Canada Research Chair in Integrative Physiology of Exercise, vascular disease is at the root of many chronic diseases currently affecting health and mobility. The health of blood vessels depends, in part, on nerves that control the constriction of blood vessels. However, since these nerves require blood from the very blood vessels they regulate, when the blood vessels become damaged by disease the nerves stop working properly, leading to a cycle of further problems in the vascular system. Shoemaker’s research will focus on how exercise, which improves vascular health, affects how nerves and blood vessels work together, how it can protect vascular and nervous system tissues, and how it affects people’s overall health and behaviour. His research will lead to understanding how the cortical autonomic network (the parts of the brain that affect the heart and blood vessels) is designed and how it functions, how nerve signals from muscles and other areas affect the brain, and how age and vascular disease interfere with normal brain structure and function. Shoemaker’s research will contribute to keeping Canada’s aging population healthy and active by helping prevent and treat vascular disease and enhancing the use of physical exercise as a treatment to complement clinical practice.

At the same time, to a computer, this music is nothing but millions of numbers with no meaning.The focus of the interdisciplinary research of Dr. George Tzanetakis, Canada Research Chair in Computer Analysis of Audio and Music, is designing algorithms that extract information from audio signals especially music and building tools to create more effective interactions between computers, listeners and musicians. Examples of such information might be the tempo of a song, whether the singer is male or female or what mood it would evoke in a listener. Most listeners, even those without musical training, are able to understand sound and music at a much deeper level than any computer can currently do. The work done by Tzanetakis combines ideas from digital signal processing, machine learning and human-computer interaction. He has applied his findings to a diverse set of domains that include creating new ways to interact with a large archive (20,000 hours worth of sound) of Orca vocalizations, building a robotic percussionist that can improvise with a human performer and automatically associating labelling tags to music recordings.

Now widely recognized as a vibrant metabolic tissue that secretes a wide range of substances that can influence how the body metabolizes glucose, it may prove to be a key to fighting Type 2 diabetes. By studying adipose tissue, Canada Research Chair in Lipids, Metabolism and Health, Dr. David Wright and his laboratory hope to develop new approaches to preventing and treating Type 2 diabetes. Since changes in how the body metabolizes glucose are a hallmark of Type 2 diabetes, understanding how the function and metabolism of adipose tissue are regulated will be crucial for understanding diabetes itself. Wright is examining how exercise and nutritional interventions affect how adipose tissue genes are expressed, and, in turn, how these changes can affect both adipose tissue’s metabolism, and the whole body’s glucose metabolism. To address these questions, Wright and his team are using a combination of physiological and cell/molecular biology techniques. Currently, the most commonly prescribed class of drugs given to individuals with Type 2 diabetes is Thiazolidinediones, or TDZs. While effective in lowering blood glucose levels, the compounds have many undesirable side-effects. The information from Wright’s studies will help researchers develop new, non-drug-based approaches that can be used to prevent and/or reverse Type 2 diabetes. "

Heart disease not only increases the risk of death, but also reduces people’s quality of life. Almost one-quarter of Canadians over the age of 70 report heart problems, suffer a decline in health and restriction of activity, and require routine assistance with the daily necessities of life. Over the last 30 years, extensive research has led to many life-saving technologies, including cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging, to reveal the presence of heart disease and aid health practitioners, patients and their families when making treatment decisions. However, without major advances, such as real-time interactive CMR imaging, patients will not see the full benefits of CMR technology for guiding therapy choices.As Canada Research Chair in Imaging for Cardiovascular Therapeutics, Dr. Graham A.

The vast majority of communication between people is nonverbal. In fact, Dr. Nicholas Rule, Canada Research Chair in Social Perception and Cognition, has discovered that split-second judgements others make about a person’s face and facial features affect how they treat that person.Through his world-leading research, Rule is exploring both the accuracy of our judgements as well as their consequences. He is particularly interested in the huge role our perceptions play in social, legal and economic decision-making. He and his research team also hope to find ways to address the limiting influence that first impressions can have on people’s social and economic opportunities. To date, Rule has discovered that a person’s sexual orientation can be accurately perceived when his or her face is viewed for only 1/25th of a second. Although there are legal protections in place for gays and lesbians, many of them continue to be discriminated against and overlooked for jobs because their sexual orientation is easily determined. Rule has also found it is possible to accurately judge how effective a person will be as a leader based only on a photo of his or her face. By using new research techniques, Rule will provide insight into the psychological processes at work in nonverbal behaviour. The results could not only help people overcome first impressions, but could also help improve Canada’s social policy. "

As Canada Research Chair in Political Ecology, Dr. Karen Bakker is investigating the causes of water insecurity around the world and aims to develop solutions to this challenge. Bakker and her research team are developing practical solutions and tools—such as water security status assessment methods—to help policy-makers, water managers and communities address water problems. This research integrates ecosystem health and human health, and brings together natural and social scientists to develop interdisciplinary solutions to the most pressing threats to water security. Threats to the quality and quantity of water are also on the rise across Canada, particularly in indigenous communities and in regions with high rates of resource development. Bakker and her team are developing practical strategies for enhancing water security for these communities, including water monitoring techniques rooted in indigenous legal traditions. Ultimately, Bakker’s research will help assess risks to water and will enhance water security both in Canada and around the world. "

Of these pregnancies, 30 to 50 per cent are intentional. The prevailing emphasis in sub-Saharan Africa on abstinence and condom use for HIV prevention has failed to take into account broader factors that influence couples’ desires to have children, or how the realization of these desires may continue HIV transmission.Since 2006, Dr. Angela Kaida, Canada Research Chair in Global Perspectives on HIV and Sexual and Reproductive Health, has worked to understand trends and predictors of reproductive intentions, behaviours and outcomes among HIV-affected couples.

When these organisms attack the body, they can be difficult to fight. In fact, an antibiotic needs to be 100 times more concentrated than usual in order to kill biofilm bacteria. Biofilm bacteria have also developed clever ways to stay alive. Some organisms in biofilms can essentially commit suicide—known as “programmed cell death” (PCD)—to enable other cells to become stronger and better able to survive. They can also remain dormant until antibiotic treatment is completed. As a result, microbes can persist for months or even years in the body and lead to recurrent infections that are very difficult to eradicate.

Some are going so far as to live outside of traditional energy grids. Through the use of ethnographic research, Dr. Phillip Vannini, Canada Research Chair in Innovative Learning and Public Ethnography, is exploring the lifestyles of people who live off the grid. Vannini is gathering stories and experiences from people across Canada as they endeavour to live their lives off the grid. He is exploring such themes as the conflict between a world that is increasingly more dependent on power and a future that relies less on massive power delivery systems. To tell the stories of those off the grid, Vannini aims to take advantage of user-friendly and relatively inexpensive new media and new technologies. Vannini’s research will shed more light on the way of life of people who choose to go off the grid. In doing so, Vannini will also help make ethnographic research as captivating and as easily accessible as the best of popular culture. "

But the disease also creates significant complications that are not well managed by current medications. These include poor planning, inability to respond to changing environments, and behavioural disturbances, such as trouble controlling impulses. Dr. Antonio Strafella, Canada Research Chair in Movement Disorders and Neuroimaging, is using brain imaging to better understand these complications. He will examine the brains of Parkinson’s patients to identify the abnormalities that lead to behavioural and cognitive problems arising from the disease.

With 26 per cent of children being overweight or obese, Canada has one of the highest rates of childhood obesity in the developed world.This problem has pulled the food industry and its marketing practices into the spotlight. Food marketing is critiqued for establishing an “obesogenic” or “toxic environment”—one where food is symbolically overvalued and always available. Yet the question of food marketing embraces more than obesity. It equally speaks to issues of health, policy and consumer perceptions toward food and eating.Dr. Charlene Elliott, Canada Research Chair in Food Marketing, Policy and Children's Health, is exploring the issue of “food communication”—food marketing, packaging and policy—in the context of children’s health. She is probing the types of foods that are being targeted specifically to children, and examining their nutritional quality and marketing.It is often observed that food is marketed to children using child-friendly appeals and that exposure to food advertising influences children’s food choices and preferences.

Her research not only deals with child-oriented food products and promotions, but also with the implications of marketing food in a particular way (for example, under the banner of “fun” or “entertainment”). These types of marketing appeals can have important implications for how children evaluate food as desirable or undesirable, and classify it in terms of health. "

Making matters worse, the heart, unlike other organs in the body, has very little ability to repair itself. Dr. Milica Radisic, Canada Research Chair in Functional Cardiovascular Tissue Engineering, aims to change this through tissue engineering. It’s a process that involves seeding cells into biomaterials in the lab—and ultimately implanting them inside human bodies. Radisic is working toward the goal of using stem cells to engineer replacement heart tissue. To achieve this goal, she will develop new biomaterials that will keep the cells alive and functional during the engineering process and allow them to integrate into the patient’s system upon implantation.While this is a long-term goal, the heart tissue Radisic is engineering also has more immediate application. She will create samples of both healthy and diseased human heart tissue that can be used as a model for drug testing and discovery. Radisic’s research could result in completely new treatments for damaged or failing hearts as well as tissues for use in such areas as bone and wound healing. "

For example, large amounts of new types of flame retardants are being used as alternatives to polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), another type of flame retardant that was recently banned in Canada. Dr. Jonathan Verreault, Canada Research Chair in Comparative Avian Toxicology, aims to identify the sources of pollutants and determine the effects that new flame retardants have on bird species that occupy top trophic positions in the food chain. He wonders: Are there differences in species of birds from temperate and northern regions in terms of their exposure and sensibility to toxic chemicals? Verreault is studying gulls, species that are ubiquitously present in heavily-polluted industrialized and agricultural regions as in less polluted Arctic regions that are undergoing rapid environmental changes, including climate change, invasive species and new pathogens. Studying the biological effects of flame retardants on gulls will provide a tremendous amount of information on the sources of exposure and the toxicity of these new substances on vulnerable and sensitive ecosystems. As part of his research, Verreault is studying the feeding ecology and space-use strategies of gulls. He is also trying to better understand the effects of pollutants on the birds’ endocrine systems and metabolic rates (bioenergetics). Verreault’s research will supply an immense amount of data and tools to evaluate the effects of new chemical substances in Canada, and will contribute to protect sensitive ecosystems and species at potential risk.

For Dr. Louise Barrett, this isn’t just a proverb but the bedrock of her approach to psychology. Barrett, Canada Research Chair in Cognition, Evolution and Behaviour, is aiming to discover how the actions of others help shape our social worlds—and therefore our psychology. She’s doing so by studying the social behaviour and cognition of both humans and our primate cousins in Canada and South Africa. Primates are known for their intense sociability, which is thought to have shaped the ways in which we think about the world. Research in this field has usually considered that social information is processed solely inside the head. However, Barrett is emphasizing how physical or bodily engagement with the world—and with other individuals—can and should be considered as part of our psychology. In that respect, cognitive processes can be considered as both visible and social, and not just invisible and private. In addition, Barrett is studying how various types of ‘social niches’ help shape psychology from infancy to adulthood, and how language and culture influence generate differences between humans and primates.By challenging long-held beliefs about the way primates think and socialize, Barrett’s work is paving the way for new forms of psychology that could improve people’s social experiences by increasing the understanding of the social skills they need in a complex society.

Many human activities introduce contaminants like metals into aquatic ecosystems—for example, mining and recycling. To evaluate the ecological risks linked to these activities, we need to characterize the ways in which these contaminants are introduced into the environment and how indigenous organisms are exposed to them. We also need to evaluate their impact. Dr. Claude Fortin, Canada Research Chair in Biogeochemistry of Trace Elements, is working on understanding and predicting how metals accumulate in our waters. Fortin’s research has three goals: developing analytical techniques that accurately measure trace metals in an ecosystem (such as a lake or river); defining the links between the chemical forms of trace metals (speciation) and the composition of the receiving environment, as well as their accumulation within the indigenous organisms; and gaining a better understanding of what happens to these metals after they are absorbed into the ecosystem. Fortin and his research team have adopted an integrated approach to the extracellular/intracellular continuum, starting from the moment aquatic organisms are exposed to trace metal contamination. For this reason, their research focuses on microscopic algae (phytoplankton). This research will lead to better tools to predict the impact metals can have on waterways. These tools will play an essential role in the work of environmental managers in the public and private sectors who are responsible for ensuring our waterways are adequately protected. They will also lead to more effective environmental protection standards. "

This is true even at the very small scale—right down to metabolism, where molecules are sorted, broken down and reassembled into the basic materials needed for an organism’s cells to function. In animal cells, small compartments called mitochondria are vital for converting nutrients and molecules for use in the energy-intensive processes of survival and growth. Environmental characteristics, such as temperature, water and the availability and quality of food, influence how an animal must budget its available energy. Dr. Jason Treberg, Canada Research Chair in Environmental Dynamics and Metabolism, is examining how environmental factors affect processes in animals at the mitochondrial level. He and his research team are exploring the idea that responses to environmental factors at the small-scale, mitochondrial level may limit animals’ abilities to respond to challenges and to survive and adapt. The insights gained from Treberg’s research will play a role in our understanding of issues ranging from animals’ susceptibility to environmental stress to how diet influences an individual’s growth and resistance to metabolic disorders and disturbances.

How does information on the current structure of the Earth help us understand the history of plate tectonics?Dr. Fiona Darbyshire, Canada Research Chair in Seismic Structure and Evolution of the Eastern Canadian Shield, is exploring how the eastern Canadian Shield evolved over geologic time and the processes that are acting on the continent today.Darbyshire is using the passage of seismic waves through the Earth from global earthquakes, captured at a network of seismic monitoring stations across Central and Eastern Canada, to provide images of the Earth’s structure. The process is similar to that of medical imaging, but on a much larger scale.The seismic waves captured by the monitoring networks provide a wealth of information—from the nature and thickness of the crust to the large-scale variations in rock properties down to depths of several hundred kilometres. They also provide vital information about the role of plate-tectonic processes in the formation and evolution of the Canadian Shield.Darbyshire’s research will answer fundamental questions about the evolution of our planet. It also has implications for natural resources in Eastern Canada, where deep Earth structure helps predict the locations of various types of mineral deposits. The seismic monitoring network Darbyshire is operating will also lead to improved knowledge about local earthquake activity and seismic hazards across Eastern Canada. "

Despite an obvious need, there are no treatments for many disabilities associated with ASDs. Before new therapies can be developed, however, more must be learned about the biology underlying the disease. To date, more than 20 genetic mutations have been linked to ASDs but the effect of most mutations on cellular function is unknown. Preliminary evidence suggests that some mutations target endocytosis, the process by which cells internalize and destroy molecules. Endocytosis also plays a critical role in structuring synapses—the connections that form circuits in the brain responsible for learning, cognition and behaviour. Dr. Christopher Brett, Canada Research Chair in Cellular Science and Human Health, is studying the obvious but untested relationship between defects in endocytosis and neurological symptoms associated with ASDs. Brett aims to understand how autism-linked mutations disrupt events required for endocytosis and how these mutations affect synapses and behaviour in mice. Brett’s research could lead to the identification of drugs that will overcome effects of these mutations on endocytosis to help treat symptoms associated with autism. "

But that’s the situation for the majority of biodiversity on our planet—tiny microbial organisms that exist beyond our immediate perception. For example, a drop of seawater may contain a million individual microbes and thousands of unique species. Multiply that abundance by the immense volume of the ocean and you quickly discover that there are more microbes found in marine systems than stars in the known universe. Not only are they abundant and diverse, but marine microbes are also essential as they do everything from controlling ocean productivity and fishery yields to producing half the oxygen in the atmosphere. Dr. David Walsh, Canada Research Chair in Microbial Ecology and Genomics, is helping answer one of today’s most important scientific questions: As climate change continues to stress ecosystems, how will marine microbes respond and what will the consequences be for ocean health? Walsh is deciphering the genetic networks that form the basis of microbial community dynamics in Canada’s oceans and describing how the networks respond to environmental stressors. Thanks to Walsh, we may be a few steps closer to predicting the relationships between environmental change and microbial community variability in the ocean. His research will ultimately lead to the development of genetic tools for monitoring environmental stress in marine ecosystems and has great potential to inform public policy and sustainability priorities.

Higher temperatures are also associated with increased diseases caused by pathogens and parasites. What effect will all this have on Canada’s cold water fish species? That’s what Dr. Brian Dixon, Canada Research Chair in Fish and Environmental Immunology, is trying to find out. Dixon is investigating the effect temperature has on the health of fish. Higher temperatures stress fish out and stress has negative impacts on the function of immune systems. By measuring the immune systems of arctic char around the polar circle, Dixon is assessing their immunological health and determining the damage climate change will have. Dixon is also examining the effect of higher temperatures on the immune systems of lake trout to determine whether pathogens will wipe them out in the near future. Since lake trout evolved during the last ice age, higher environmental temperatures may have critical effects on their survival. In addition, Dixon is examining how low temperatures, which also reduce immunity, cause tumours in walleye. The tumours are caused by a virus that may be unleashed when low temperatures turn off their immune system.Dixon’s research will provide the answers needed to develop policies and management techniques that are critical for ensuring the survival of Canada’s cold water fish species for generations to come.

The future of computing, however, lies in cloud computing, in which users will connect devices such as computers, tablets, and phones to data centres via the Internet, to access resources that exceed the capacity possible in any of their devices. Getting these data centres running, however, will require exascale supercomputers—computers that are more than 100 times faster than today’s most powerful supercomputer. These computer systems will collect and process an unprecedented amount of information, and will also help us create more intelligent systems, such as power grids that deliver power more efficiently. However, there is a big barrier to exascale computing—energy usage. Dr. Joyce Poon, Canada Research Chair in Integrated Photonic Devices, is working to develop efficient, ultra-compact and high-speed devices that will consume very little energy to make these future computer systems possible. She is doing so through the innovative use of photonics, which uses light in optical guides instead of electrical signals in metallic wires to transmit data with less energy.Poon’s research will benefit researchers and companies that are developing photonic technologies for computing—and ultimately all of us when we reap the benefits of exascale computing.

That’s because the bacteria are developing resistance to the drugs used against them and some, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Clostridium difficile and some strains of tuberculosis, have even developed into “super bugs” that are impervious to most antibiotics. The World Health Organization considers the rise of these super bugs as a new health care crisis.Dr. Mirek Cygler, Canada Research Chair in Molecular Medicine Using Synchrotron Light, is working to keep ahead of bacterial resistance by identifying new drug targets that will guide the development of new classes of antibiotics. He is exploring a strategy that involves targeting only the bacteria’s ability to cause disease – rather than just killing the whole pathogen – which will therefore reduce pressure to develop resistance.Cygler also aims to understand bacterial effector proteins – molecules that interact with host cell proteins to essentially “pick the lock” and invade the cell. Once past the cell’s defences, these bacteria can use the cell’s resources to live and reproduce.Cygler is using the power of Canada’s national synchrotron (a source of brilliant light that scientists use to gather information about the properties of materials at the molecular level) facility in Saskatchewan to determine the shape and structure of effector proteins. Using intense X-rays produced by the synchrotron, he is seeking to map these proteins in three dimensions. Cygler’s research will provide new ammunition in the war against super bugs and could turn the tide against the bacteria. "

A considerable proportion of these patients will require acute dialysis to support their failing kidneys. This not only greatly increases the complexity and costs of care for these patients, but is also associated with an unacceptably high risk of death. Many patients who survive will need long-term chronic dialysis therapy. While acute dialysis therapy has been used in sick patients for decades, important aspects of how this therapy is applied are not clearly understood. In particular, it is still not known when is the best time to start dialysis in patients whose kidneys are injured and failing. This critical knowledge gap in the care of patients has contributed to inconsistencies in practice.Dr. Sean Bagshaw, Canada Research Chair in Critical Care Nephrology, is studying the optimal timing to start dialysis therapy in these patients. His research will include a series of clinical studies and trials to understand how best to select patients for acute dialysis and when therapy should ideally begin. Bagshaw will also integrate new diagnostic methods for detecting kidney injury and predicting its severity. Bagshaw’s findings could lead to improved quality of care and clinical outcomes, and may completely change the process for how critically-ill patients with severe kidney failure begin to receive dialysis.

That’s the goal of Dr. Timothy Kelly, Canada Research Chair in Photovoltaics, who is working on a different approach to the solar cells that are the most direct way to produce electricity from sunlight. Silicon-based photovoltaics currently in use are expensive to manufacture, which limits their adoption. Kelly is working to overcome this hurdle through the use of organic photovoltaics, which are dramatically cheaper to produce but are also much less powerful. Currently, the best organic versions work at only about 8-12 per cent efficiency and are no better than lower-end inorganic solar cells. Kelly is working to overcome two major challenges that stand in the way of the next generation of organic photovoltaics: Better light absorption in the near-infrared range, where much of the sun’s output resides, and more efficient collection of the electricity generated by the sunlight.To achieve all this, Kelly is looking to develop new silver nanostructures (objects sized between molecular and microscopic length scales) for better light absorption. The nanostructured solar cell he’s aiming to create will be designed to absorb maximum light while still providing a clear pathway to deliver the resulting electricity.Kelly’s work to improve the efficiency of organic photovoltaics will result in a technology that provides safe, clean and renewable energy.

During development, the same cells can repeatedly switch from tissue formation to cell division and back again. When the normal controls that regulate cell division are lost or when signals for tissue formation between cells are improperly regulated, the result is often cancer. The mechanisms that link the critical processes of cell division and tissue formation between cells remain poorly understood. However, Dr. Sarah Hughes.

More than 33 million people worldwide are living with HIV, including about 65,000 Canadians. Preventing the spread and finding a cure for HIV/AIDS are global health priorities.Dr. Mark Brockman, Canada Research Chair in Viral Pathogenesis and Immunity, is exploring how the body can protect itself against HIV infection. He is looking at interactions on the molecular level and studying the immune response to HIV in rare individuals who can spontaneously control infection. Evidence suggests these people naturally suppress HIV through responses by white blood cells called T lymphocytes.However, it is unclear how a vaccine could stimulate such robust immunity. Brockman is seeking to gather new information about spontaneous HIV control that will assist in the development of new vaccines. He’s doing so by studying how the virus replicates and mutates in response to antiviral T lymphocytes. Brockman is collaborating with colleagues in regions of Sub-Saharan Africa, where up to 40 per cent of adults now live with HIV. His ties to researchers in South Africa, Lesotho, Zambia, Rwanda and Uganda are bringing critical expertise and training to where it is needed most.Brockman’s research should improve the understanding of natural immunity to HIV and help identify new targets for vaccine and treatment.

Some people living with MS suffer vision problems, including blindness, while others lose the ability to think clearly and experience mood swings. Canada has some of the highest incidence of MS in the world and effective treatments remain elusive.Dr. Bogdan Popescu, Canada Research Chair in Multiple Sclerosis Research, is combining tissue preparation and microscopy techniques with the power of synchrotron light (a source of brilliant light) to explore the role of metals in the health of oligodendrocytes. Oligodendrocytes are specialized cells that manufacture myelin, the insulation for the “wiring” of our nervous system. In MS, these myelin sheaths are destroyed, interfering with nerve signals.Iron, copper and zinc are known to be essential for creating and maintaining myelin—and oligodendrocytes have the highest metal content of all nerve cells. Popescu believes that disrupting metal metabolism in these crucial cells will impair them to carry on their main function—maintaining the nerves’ myelin sheaths, which will quickly degrade. About a quarter of MS cases may involve this process.Popescu’s research in metal metabolism could lead to identification of possible targets for new drugs and treatments for MS. "

How can new products that don’t fit categories that we are used to be marketed to overcome this reluctance? Those are just a few of the questions Dr.Tripat Gill, Canada Research Chair in Market Insight and Innovation, is investigating. Gill is focusing his research on “usage-based disruptions” and “user-based disruptions” of stereotypes. Usage-based disruptions are due to changes in the use associated with a product. For example, smartphones are not only telephones but also computers, cameras and music players. User-based disruptions involve changing the user-group of a product, such as the introduction of skin care products for men, hand tools for women or video games for seniors. These disruptions can create confusion in consumers’ minds and significant barriers when it comes to adopting new products: Is a smartphone a telephone or a computer? Are men really expected to use face scrubs? Gill is using marketing and psychology approaches to discover more about these barriers and propose strategies to overcome them. New products that disrupt category stereotypes are commonplace in the high-technology industry and in the personal care, public health and social sectors. Gill’s research has clear implications for product innovation and marketing. It will improve understanding of the different psychological barriers to the adoption of new products and will help marketing managers modify their consumer communication strategies. "

Yet despite considerable research, the underlying causes are not well understood. Dr. Ian Colman, Canada Research Chair in Mental Health Epidemiology, is investigating modifiable causes of depression and suicidality in three vulnerable populations: children and adolescents, military personnel, and prisoners. In partnership with local and national agencies as well as researchers from several countries, he and his research team are studying population-wide health data for clues. This includes mental health assessments of thousands of Canadian children who were followed by Statistics Canada from 1994 to 2009; all members of the armed forces; and all Canadian prisoners sentenced for two years or more. Colman aims to better understand how factors that have been shown to increase the risk for depression and suicidal behaviour relate to each other. For example, childhood adversity, parental mental illness, substance abuse, low levels of social support, and recent stressful events are all associated with depression—but it is not clear how they relate to each other or which would best respond to intervention. Using advanced statistical methods, Colman and his team are also estimating the potential effects of prevention and intervention programs in reducing depression and suicidal behaviour. This approach will enable them to produce research that could influence policy and practice at the local, national and international levels. Ultimately, it could lead to better outcomes for people who are at risk of or experience depression. "

Dawson is focusing on communities that are seeing their economies ruined by changing environmental conditions and on communities that are witnessing new economic opportunities due to the changing environment. Communities in Canada and around the world that rely on vulnerable environmental resources have long been prone to boom or bust economic cycles. These cycles are even more prevalent in today’s era of rapid economic development and globalization. That has made it more important than ever for communities to weigh the pros and cons of development and pay close attention to resilience, adaptation and related economic policy.Dawson’s research will increase knowledge and reduce the environmental and public safety risks associated with changing environmental and socio-economic conditions in communities.

In most cases, people that become infected with the virus exhibit very mild or only flu-like symptoms. However, the virus causes severe neurological illness in a significant number of patients, resulting in hospitalization and even death.Dr. Tom Hobman, Canada Research Chair in RNA Viruses and Host Interactions, is working towards identifying targets for anti-viral therapy for West Nile virus and related RNA viruses, which could eventually eliminate or reduce the medical burden of these pathogens.Hobman is studying how RNA viruses—viruses whose genomes are comprised of RNA—interact with host cell proteins to influence virus replication and development of disease. In addition to West Nile virus, Hobman is examining Rubella virus, which is responsible for more birth defects than any other infectious agent, and Dengue virus, the virus that causes Dengue fever, which an estimated 2.5 billion people are at risk of developing. Hobman is looking at how virus-encoded capsid proteins affect the functions of cellular pathways involved in the virus-host response. He aims to identify common and unique mechanisms by which these proteins affect cell death by viruses on host cells, which allows the virus to spread.

Canada’s aging population demands innovative strategies for the treatment of these diseases, since traditional therapies such as transplantation, surgery and drugs are often inadequate and expensive. The emerging field of regenerative medicine promises to revolutionize medical care for chronic diseases by harnessing the power of stem cells to repair and replace damaged cells and tissues. Regenerative therapies are already beginning to be used and the future potential is immense.Dr. William Stanford, Canada Research Chair in Integrative Stem Cell Biology, aims to make regenerative medicine a reality for Canadian patients by advancing understanding of the biological processes that control stem cells. Stanford is particularly interested in genetic reprogramming techniques that can be used to turn normal adult cells, such as skin cells, into powerful induced pluripotent stem cells (adult cells that have been genetically reprogrammed to an embryonic stem cell-like state). These stem cells can then be coaxed into giving rise to more specialized cells and tissues, such as cartilage to treat arthritis and heart tissue to treat heart disease. Stanford is also using these stem cells to study the development of cancer, heart disease and other conditions. Stanford’s research should lead to the development of revolutionary therapies that see stem cells used to target the underlying causes of chronic diseases. "

How do scientists choose a material for an implant? There are many candidates, but the material's surface deserves special attention: minutes after a medical procedure ends, serum proteins begin to adsorb at the biomaterial's surface, and cells adhere and spread. These early interfacial events are critically important in determining if our bodies ultimately accept or reject an implant.Dr. Marta Cerruti, Canada Research Chair in Biosynthetic Interfaces, is developing biodegradable scaffolds with a surface designed to promote a specific response from the cells and the fluids in contact with it—in other words, materials that speak the same language as the human body.Her research focuses on both hard and soft tissue regeneration. For example, she studies molecular cues that affect the precipitation of hydroxyapatite, the mineral phase in bones and teeth. Biomaterials that join to these hard tissues need to promote the formation of this mineral, while those that replace cartilage or blood vessels need to inhibit it.Implants made with materials modified with these cues will help stimulating the body's own healing potential, thus ensuring a successful outcome.Prosthetics for soft and hard tissue repair have improved a lot thanks to the new materials and techniques introduced in the last 50 years; Cerruti's research on interfaces between materials and cells and body fluids will introduce a new paradigm that will improve these implants even more.

Her research focuses on families that are challenging traditional gender norms around work and care—such as primary caregiving fathers and primary breadwinning mothers—and the lessons that emerge from them. Doucet is exploring changes in care and work experiences across three generations. She is also shining a spotlight on the challenges faced by men who take up caregiving of infants, children, and the elderly. Doucet’s research will contribute greatly to public and policy debates aimed at increasing gender equalities in paid work and care work. She will also engage a wide public audience through cutting-edge narrative and visual/digital methodologies that capture and convey a rich diversity of stories on changing work and family lives. "

Most advanced industrialized nations have laws prohibiting employers from discriminating against workers on the basis of sex, race and ethnicity. But outlawing a practice doesn’t necessarily eliminate it. Discrimination against women and racial minorities persists and thousands of workers file formal legal claims of sex and race bias every year. Dr. Elizabeth Hirsh, Canada Research Chair in Social Inequality and Law, is examining the extent to which laws against discrimination and legal claims minimize sex and race discrimination in the workplace. She asks how people identify discrimination on the job, what leads them to file legal claims and whether formal claims reduce employment discrimination among employers that are targeted.Hirsh’s research is part of a larger research agenda to understand if and how the law affects social inequality. She has previously demonstrated that legal claims in the United States are most effective at reducing inequality when accompanied by sustained political and economic pressure. Hirsh will be extending her work to anti-discrimination laws in Canada and undertaking a comparative analysis of the United States and Canada. The guarantee of equal opportunity is a defining characteristic of modern democracies and Hirsh’s work focuses on how this ideal plays out in practice. Her research will identify policies that promote equality of opportunity and demonstrate how the law can most effectively be used for social change. "

However, questions remain as to whether we can understand these changes and identify the factors that are influencing the environment and our health. The questions are all around us: Why are there no more fish in the lake? Is our climate changing more rapidly than in the past? What impact did contact with that chemical have on my health? Measuring tiny numbers of radioactive atoms that occur in nature is one powerful way to solve these scientific questions. Radioactive atoms can do everything from calculating when the environment changed even if no one was there to watch, to tracing a molecule that is moving in the brain without the need for surgery. Dr. Jack Cornett, Canada Research Chair in Radiochemistry and Environmental Health, is developing a new technique to measure radioactive atoms using the unique capabilities of an accelerator mass spectrometer (or atom buster). The technique allows extremely tiny amounts of radioactivity to be measured in very small samples. For example, samples of a few pollen grains, human hair or drops of blood can be used to unlock environmental and health mysteries. The practical applications of accelerator mass spectrometry range throughout science—from deciphering where a drug goes inside the brain, to determining how much radiation exposure will occur around a nuclear waste management facility.Cornett’s research on atom busters will lead to applications that are limited only by our imagination.

Where does morality come from? The answer used to be obvious: morality is the result of learning. Through teaching from parents, interactions with peers and observations of how others act, we learn which actions are right and which are wrong, who is good and who is bad, who deserves praise and who should be punished. But while there is no doubt that experience plays a large role in moral development, the work of Dr. Kiley Hamlin, Canada Research Chair in Developmental Psychology, is showing that some aspects of morality, such as liking good guys and disliking bad guys, may be innate. Hamlin is studying very young infants who arguably lack many of the experiences we may think are required for moral judgments. She presents infants with brief puppet interactions in which a character gets helped by a nice puppet and harmed by a mean puppet. After the show, infants choose between the nice and mean puppets and an overwhelming majority of them choose the good guy. Through this and many other studies, Hamlin is exploring the earliest developmental emergence of human social and moral judgment. Her research may completely change the way we think about morality, both developmentally and in its adult form. "

Almost every object that appears on our dinner plates is the end result of a breeding program in which specific traits have been selected for decades or even millennia. But breeding is also an essential part of our future.Traditionally, when breeders aim to generate a new cultivar (plant selected for desirable characteristics) of a crop, they choose parents with desirable traits and make them reproduce. Often, hundreds or thousands of the resulting offspring are grown, but only a select few may be deemed worthy of commercial use. While this process has generated most of the food we enjoy today, it is also laborious, time-consuming and expensive.Dr. Sean Myles, Canada Research Chair in Agricultural Genetic Diversity, aims to help make the breeding process more efficient and cost-effective by helping breeders decide which offspring to keep and which offspring to discard. He is doing this through marker-assisted breeding, which uses genetic information to guide the breeding process.The challenge lies in determining what constitutes a desirable genetic profile and what does not. Myles is figuring out which DNA variants in apple trees are associated with desirable traits, such as sweetness/acidity balance, and which are not.Myles’ research will enable breeders to predict what apples will taste like before trees are fully grown. It will also help develop food that tastes better and requires less chemicals to grow. "

So says Dr. Evangelos Michelakis, Canada Research Chair in Applied Molecular and Mitochondrial Medicine, who is taking a fresh approach to medicine by challenging long-lasting dogmas. For example, Michelakis has challenged the longstanding belief that the mitochondria (the power centres of the cell) are not involved in the cause of cancer. In fact, he has found that both cancer and pulmonary hypertension are caused by excessive growth of cells in various parts of the body that is caused in part by defects in mitochondria. He has also recently shown that drugs that can reactivate mitochondria can result in the regression of both cancer and pulmonary hypertension, without affecting healthy tissues in the body.Michelakis is now taking his findings to the next level by performing several early-phase clinical trials aimed at efficiently translating his discoveries to patients. As well, he is studying the use of generic drugs for the treatment of these conditions which, if found effective, would result in major cost savings for governments and taxpayers.He is also involved in the development of a new training program on the emerging principles of molecular and mitochondrial medicine.The fresh approach Michelakis is taking to medicine could result in effective and inexpensive treatments for two deadly diseases.

When the best laid plans run into obstacles, stress and self-doubt can derail our good intentions to reach our goals and have a negative impact on our health and well-being. To navigate through these challenges, some people use mental simulations (mental rehearsals of past or future events) to help them savour the journey.Dr. Fuschia Sirois, Canada Research Chair in Health and Well-being, is investigating the mental strategies that help people focus on their journey to reach the goal and the personal characteristics that help or hinder use of these strategies. Sirois believes mental simulation strategies that promote “goal-stocktaking” (taking an inventory of the past, present and future of goals) can enhance health and well-being during the pursuit of goals. They do so by providing opportunities for finding meaning, control and direction. When people feel positive about their goals, they are more likely to reach them. Helping people follow through with healthy lifestyle goals is essential to manage the rising rates of obesity and chronic illness in Canada and elsewhere. Sirois is studying goal-stocktaking strategies in both healthy and chronically ill populations and developing interventions that will help people focus on and savour the journey.Sirois’ research will advance knowledge about how to improve health and well-being as people pursue their life goals.

Improved injury prevention is recognized as a priority in Canada and around the world. Dr. Barbara Morrongiello, Canada Research Chair in Child and Youth Injury Prevention, is identifying key factors that influence injury risk and developing strategies to reduce those risks, including developing policies and programs that can be distributed widely to reduce the burden of injury in Canada and abroad. Morrongiello has produced major innovations in measurement that make it possible to conduct scientifically-rigorous research to better understand children’s risk of injury and to develop new approaches to prevention. These innovations include measurement of caregiver supervision and of the risks children take at playgrounds and when crossing streets. Since injury risk factors vary among children, Morrongiello takes into account their age, social and physical context, and individual traits. She considers both social and psychological factors that influence safety and risk behaviours and emphasizes how these factors interact to influence injury risk. Morrongiello is also collaborating with public health departments, Safe Kids Canada, and other national organizations that are committed to injury prevention. These collaborations help translate her findings into effective policies and community programming for injury prevention.

In fact, computers do not understand these high-level programs, and it is the job of compilers to translate very technical software to efficient low-level programs that can be run on target computers. Modern compiler tools and techniques ensure that computer programs are efficient, easily maintained, and help programmers eliminate software bugs. It is especially vital that compiler tools are developed to meet the specific needs of scientists and engineers.Professor Laurie Hendren, Canada Research Chair in Compiler Tools and Techniques, and her compiler tools group is currently working to that end, attacking a wide variety of challenges for the benefit of scientists and engineers worldwide.The trend among scientists and researchers is towards using dynamic scripting languages such as Python, Perl and MATLAB. Although these languages may be convenient for quickly developing initial program prototypes, they are notoriously difficult to execute efficiently and their use often leads to unstructured and buggy programs. Hendren’s answer is the construction of compiler toolkits that help programmers, engineers and scientists build faster, more maintainable and more correct programs. These toolkits are used by Hendren’s own research group to experiment with new approaches for scientific languages, as well as new tools to aid programmers in testing and refactoring applications. The toolkits are open-source and can be freely used by other compiler researchers, who can also contribute to this important area.Hendren’s research group has a long history of building compiler toolkits for compiler researchers worldwide.

It is a debilitating disease in which the myelin sheath (a layer of fat and proteins) that surrounds nerve cells is degraded, preventing the transmission of signals from the brain to muscles and organs. The origins of this disease are unknown but are believed to involve the “perfect storm” of genetic susceptibility and environmental triggers. A protein called myelin basic protein, is a key to understanding the molecular causes of MS.Dr. George Harauz, Canada Research Chair in Myelin Biology, is exploring myelin basic protein, which has been exceptionally difficult to study because it does not have a single structure or function.Harauz is using a variety of techniques to investigate how myelin basic protein adapts and interacts with other structural and signalling proteins in the cell. He is focusing on how specific enzymatic modifications to myelin basic protein affect its structure and its interactions with other proteins, especially during early myelin development in childhood and during the progression of MS.Harauz’s research is helping determine how these various proteins communicate with one another in laying down the intact myelin sheath.By doing so, Harauz will help uncover what starts to go wrong in MS, when the body's own immune system attacks myelin components and prevents myelin repair.

Dr. Martin Schmeing, Canada Research Chair in Macromolecular Machines, is studying a class of proteins called nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS), which synthesize (or put together) these compounds in microbes. NRPSs produce a myriad of compounds that can interact with living tissues or systems. These include penicillin (the first widely-used antibiotic), viomycin (an antibiotic used to treat multidrug-resistant tuberculosis) and cyclosporine (which is used as an immunosuppressant in organ transplants).Schmeing is expanding the knowledge of the mechanisms these proteins use to synthesize important drugs. He is using a number of techniques to understand how building blocks are chemically assembled into antibiotics, how NRPSs undergo the large-scale rearrangements needed to make these drugs, and other matters.NRPSs hold a vast potential to produce new drugs. Because NRPSs are divided into segments, with each segment adding one building block to the drug, it is possible to switch the order and specific type of segments to produce new variants of the drug. Schmeing’s research will provide better understanding of how to best rearrange NRPS segments. His work could result in millions of new compounds, including drugs to fight antibiotic resistant bacteria, viruses and cancer. "

They may be tiny, but they play an important role in the ocean’s ability to regulate climate. By using sunlight to convert inorganic carbon to biomass, they help fuel marine ecosystems and regulate carbon dioxide (CO2) and oxygen concentrations in the atmosphere. The ocean has already absorbed about half of the CO2 released from burning fossil fuels. It is expected that increasing CO2 levels over the next century will further alter the physical and chemical properties of the upper layer of the sea surface, including temperature, inorganic carbon concentration and nutrient and light conditions. In addition, pollution and the depleting ozone layer are adding to the stress on marine ecosystems. The question Dr. Zoe Finkel, Canada Research Chair in Marine Environmental Ecology, is looking to answer is: How will phytoplankton communities respond to these changes? Finkel and her team are investigating how different species of phytoplankton respond to environmental changes. Using controlled laboratory experiments, they are trying to determine how these species respond to changes in single and multiple environmental conditions along ecological and evolutionary timescales. This research will improve our understanding of how phytoplankton communities may respond to future environmental changes. Ultimately, Finkel’s findings will be used to improve the projections for how phytoplankton and the marine carbon cycle will change—and be changed by—climate in the decades and centuries ahead. "

But what is less known is that organisms help to regulate climate. Dr. Merritt Turetsky, Canada Research Chair in Integrative Ecology, is studying the ecological processes that affect the earth’s climate system, such as the release and uptake of greenhouse gases and water by plants and microbes in soil. Organisms have the ability to amplify or diminish future climate change through these processes. Turetsky is particularly interested in the interactions between ecology and climate in boreal areas. The boreal forest is important to our climate system because of its huge size and abundance of trees and wetlands. Boreal ecosystems have formed under stressful conditions, including harsh winters, but are likely to see more frequent droughts, large wildfires and other stresses as a result of climate change. It is not clear how resilient boreal ecosystems will be under changing environmental conditions because of their low species diversity. Turetsky is using several techniques to examine how plant traits in boreal forests and wetlands regulate climate by controlling carbon, nutrient and water cycling. She is also examining how climate change is interacting with natural disturbances and human land use to affect ecosystem functions. The ecological and societal effects of climate change have become global issues. However, the interactions between ecology and climate are not well understood and are under-represented in earth systems models.

A few examples: Does morality depend on us and our ways of thinking, or is it entirely independent of such factors? And, are there some fundamental elements of the universe on which everything else depends, such as the smallest subatomic particles or the distribution of matter right after the Big Bang?Dr. Carrie Jenkins, Canada Research Chair in Philosophy, believes that before there can be any chance of answering such big questions, understanding is needed of what these questions are really asking. This requires an understanding that dependence comes in many varieties, with explanatory dependence one of the most interesting and important varieties. Her research centres on the hypothesis that a lot of the biggest questions we ask are really questions about “what explains what?”Jenkins notes that when philosophers wonder whether morality is dependent on the mind, they are wondering whether moral facts need to be explained in terms of our opinions and ways of thinking. The same goes for all sorts of other questions about truth, reality, meaning and knowledge. Explanation is of crucial importance to our understanding of ourselves and the universe around us.Jenkins’ research lies at the heart of fundamental philosophy and promises to reshape contemporary understanding of some of the deepest and most universal questions people are capable of asking.

Bacteria, such as E. coli are small and open, like a studio apartment. Eukaryotic cells, including animals, plants, algae and parasites, tend to be much larger and divided into compartments, like a three-bedroom apartment. Nearly all of the biological diversity that we see today is due to the ability of cells to compartmentalize. That ability resulted in a monumental shift in the course of life on Earth nearly two billion years ago. Dr. Joel B. Dacks, Canada Research Chair in Evolutionary Cell Biology, aims to understand the evolutionary forces that generate and shape these compartments.Dacks is studying the compartments of the membrane-trafficking system, which is involved in nearly all of the production and targeting of material in our cells. This system is key for accurate delivery of hormones, nervous system action, plant growth and for the disease-causing action of our most deadly parasites. By analyzing data from DNA sequencing technologies, Dacks is investigating the machinery encoded in the genomes of algae and parasites that is responsible for making the membrane-trafficking system run. He is comparing this information with information from humans and plants to identify important commonalities. These not only reveal ancient features, but also identify unexplored aspects of human cellular biology. Dacks is also identifying unique features in ocean algae that improve our understanding of these drivers of environmental cycles or in human parasites, which will pave the way for new treatment targets.The information Dacks finds will contribute greatly to developing models of the events and processes that have sculpted life into its myriad forms.

The application of Darwinian models to the study of cultural change—known as cultural evolution—has sparked much interest and criticism in recent decades. Dr. Gillian K. D. Crozier, Canada Research Chair in Environment, Culture and Values, is using her expertise in the philosophy of science to investigate the relationship between cultures and environments by applying evolutionary theoretical models to the analysis of cultural change. Crozier is exploring the potential of computer simulations to evaluate theoretical debates surrounding cultural evolution. Her recent practical work has shown how observed patterns of bird song propagation in different natural environments provide a rich testing ground for cultural evolutionary ideas. In her other area of research, Crozier is using bioethics to investigate the moral dimensions of international trade in health-related goods and services in our increasingly global marketplace. For example, the increasing movements of health care workers and patients raise a variety of challenges and opportunities in the pursuit of social justice. Are migrant healthcare workers generally better off having migrated? How can we weigh the impacts of large scale migration on health care recipients in the source and destination countries? Crozier’s use of challenging real-world cases is helping in the development of the promising and exciting field of cultural evolution. In addition, her use of bioethics is helping us focus on moral implications of decisions involving people who are in vulnerable circumstances. "

Chirality recognition refers to nature’s fascinating ability to discriminate between a pair of non-superposable mirror images. For example, our noses can smell different lemon and orange scents in a mirror image pair of limonene (a colourless liquid hydrocarbon). The subtle change of replacing a chiral drug by its mirror image can have drastically different pharmacological and biological effects on our body.For more than a century, Nobel Prize-winning chemist Emil Fischer’s “lock-and-key” principle has been used to rationalize such recognition processes empirically. It has been a longstanding dream of researchers to measure these fascinating processes rigorously and accurately.Dr. Yunjie Xu, Canada Research Chair in Chirality and Chirality Recognition, is measuring how various intermolecular interaction forces come together in a concerted way to achieve chirality recognition in such complex environments as aqueous solutions (solutions in which the solvent is water) and metal clusters.To tackle the challenges of achieving quantitative descriptions of complex chirality recognition processes in the real world, Xu has crafted her research to bridge the knowledge gap from the gas phase to aqueous conditions under which most biological events occur.Xu is using and developing highly sophisticated spectroscopic techniques (involving the interaction between matter and radiated energy) to capture chirality recognition processes with unprecedented details in order to gain quantitative insights into these fascinating processes.Xu’s research could have far-reaching impacts in areas ranging from the creation of more efficient chiral catalysts (substances that increase the rate of chemical reaction) to the design of better drugs.

Canada’s economic success and the quality of life of its citizens will require better understanding of pollutants in the environment.Where do pollutants come from, where do they go, and what happens in the process? Dr. Julian Aherne, Canada Research Chair in Environmental Modelling, is searching for answers to these and other questions. Aherne is doing so by developing, evaluating and using computer models to help improve our understanding and management of pollutants in the environment. Aherne is analyzing soil, water and air samples in the lab and is using that data to create equations and formulas as the basis for computer models. These tools will provide him with a fast-forward look at what would eventually happen to the pollutants in the soil, water and air. Aherne’s ability to successfully model what pollutants are doing now will allow researchers to predict what they will do in the future. Unlocking these mysteries will allow us to forecast our future environmental status, and to make decisions today that will enhance the quality of our natural environment, and our wellbeing, tomorrow.

Dr. Sonia Anand, Canada Research Chair in Ethnic Diversity and Cardiovascular Disease, is identifying health behaviour risk factors in diverse ethnic groups. Anand is examining factors such as elevated blood glucose levels, dietary patterns and genetic factors to develop prevention strategies to reduce cardio-metabolic risk factors and CVD for those most in jeopardy. She is also examining these factors in diverse populations across the infant-child-adult life span. Anand aims to identify adverse health behaviours and genetic factors that will shed light on the causes of CVD risk factors among high-risk groups. Identification of these behaviours and genetic factors could also improve the accuracy of risk prediction for diabetes and CVD and motivate behavioural changes. In addition, her approach could validate ethnic-specific measurement tools that will allow for comparisons across diverse ethnic populations. Anand is also studying genetic molecular discoveries and data on dietary factors, such as energy intake and macronutrient composition. This information will offer excellent windows into how environmental and genetic measures affect the development of cardio-metabolic factors in high-risk groups. Anand’s examination of high risk populations will provide greater insight into the causes and risk factors of CVD.

The research indicates that a layer of biochemical information associated with the DNA and known as the epigenome is also heritable. These findings come from the field of epigenetics, which shows how people’s environment and the choices they make can influence their genetic code and that of their descendants. The epigenome is passed from generation to generation, in a process called epigenetic inheritance. Remarkably, the epigenome has a memory and contains information about a parent's lifetime experiences, such as exposure to poor diet or toxicants. Epigenetic inheritance may explain complex diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, behavioural disorders and cancer. Dr. Sarah Kimmins, Canada Research Chair in Epigenetics, Reproduction and Environment, is studying how the epigenome in the gametes (sperm) and oocyte (immature female reproductive cell prior to fertilization) functions in offspring development and disease. Her research aims to understand how environmental exposures to a parent, such as diets and toxicants, can alter the epigenome in gametes and to determine the consequences on offspring. The information Kimmins uncovers will help improve understanding of how parents pass diseases to offspring and pave the way for new strategies to improve the health of children. The information generated by her research will also eventually result in more in-depth pre-conception advising for men and women. "

New treatments and blood pressure management strategies to help patients recover to their full capacity are desperately needed. Enter Dr. Ken Butcher, Canada Research Chair in Cerebrovascular Disease, who is looking at several ways to reduce the impact of ischemic stroke, which occurs when a blocked artery reduces blood flow to the brain, and hemorrhagic stroke, which results from brain blood vessel rupture.Butcher is exploring the utility of measuring blood flow to the brain, with MRI and advanced CT technology, to select patients for thrombolytic (clot-dissolving drugs) therapy. This will ultimately allow treatment of patients as much as 24 hours after symptom onset, instead of the current recommendation of 4.5 hours post-stroke.As well, Butcher is looking into the use of novel antithrombotic therapy (used to prevent clots) within 24 hours for patients who suffer a minor stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA). Research shows these patients have a higher risk of having another stroke three months later, but newer drugs may reduce that risk. In addition, he is investigating whether it is safe to moderately reduce blood pressure in patients within 48 hours following stroke.Finally, Butcher is studying the safety and utility of lowering blood pressure in patients with hemorrhagic stroke. He aims to demonstrate that blood pressure reduction may slow the rate of bleeding into the brain and therefore help patients.This research will make it easier to use blood flow imaging techniques in clinical practice to guide treatment for stroke patients. It could also lead to the development of newer treatments and improved strategies for blood pressure control in stroke patients. "

In the last few years, Hollywood movies have dramatized the possibility that human beings could one day meet their own demise through a similar catastrophe. Are they right?The less dramatic reality is that our world continues to be showered by material from outer space. These smaller meteors, called meteoroids or meteorites, are nowhere near the size of an object that could cause the extinction of a species. Nevertheless, we are only beginning to understand the nature of this astrophysical phenomenon. And now that we have sophisticated radar and satellite systems, and have even sent spacecraft to visit these bodies in space, our understanding is beginning to grow.In the early 1990s, for example, the first detailed video record of a meteorite fireball made it possible to determine the orbit from which this object had fallen to earth. Peter Brown and his colleagues calculated this orbit—a computational feat that has been possible in only a handful of cases where a meteorite has been recovered.As the holder of a Canada Research Chair, Brown intends to continue investigating the origins and physical features of meteors. He plans to develop computer models of how they might be distributed throughout the solar system. And he’ll use radar, sound, and satellite data to document actual examples of meteors arriving on earth.This research will provide more reliable estimates of the number of meteors travelling near the earth that might be large enough to be seen by telescope. Brown also expects to measure the energy released—in the form of sound and light—as those meteors enter the atmosphere and strike the earth. In this context, he plans to more accurately consider the question of how large one of those meteors would have to be to cause significant damage if it struck the earth. "

The retina, one of the most accessible and anatomically well-defined parts of the central nervous system, is ideal for investigating synaptic mechanisms (or nerve impulses) involved in nerve computations. Dr. Gautam Awatramani, Canada Research Chair in Synaptic Physiology, is using a variety of state-of-the-art techniques to understand how visual information is processed by circuits in healthy and diseased retinas. A major focus of his research involves understanding how retinal circuits extract information about the direction of objects moving in visual space. By obtaining detailed understanding of the physiological properties of retinal circuitry in animal models, Awatramani also aims to devise new strategies to restore retinal function among people with neurodegenerative diseases known to lead to irreversible blindness. Specifically, optogenetic approaches are being developed to re-sensitize the retina to light after damage to the photoreceptor. By reprogramming remnant nerves of diseased retinas to play the role of missing photoreceptors, some vision can be partially restored in animals without photoreceptors.

They are precursors of Type Ia supernovae (which result from the violent explosion of white dwarf stars that have completed their normal life cycles), X-ray binaries (stars that are luminous in X-rays) and double neutron stars (remnants resulting from the gravitational collapse of massive stars during a supernova event). Interacting stars are also likely to be the most important candidates for gravitational wave detection (experiments designed to measure minute distortions of space-time predicted by Einstein’s theory of general relativity). They also played an important role in the formation of the first stars of the early universe. But while interacting stars are abundant, they are poorly understood. Dr. Natalia Ivanova, Canada Research Chair in Astronomy and Astrophysics and an expert in the study of binary stars, is using a variety of numerical methods to research everything from the evolution of specific binary stars and the collisions of two stars to populations of interacting stars. Ivanova is fascinated with the different kinds of interactions stars can have, especially the common envelope event—a short-lived phase in the evolution of a binary star, in which the largest of two stars initiates unstable mass transfer to its companion star. She will work on understanding this extremely sophisticated and highly important event.

Reductions in brain blood flow are associated with diseases and conditions like stroke, vascular dementia, Alzheimer’s disease and migraine that cause enormous economic, physical and emotional costs to society. Brain cells co-ordinate and regulate the delivery of glucose and oxygen by changing the diameter of brain blood vessels to speed up or slow down blood flow as needed. But how the brain communicates to blood vessels to accomplish this is not fully understood. Dr. Grant Gordon, Canada Research Chair Cellular Mechanisms of Cerebral Blood Flow Control, is performing groundbreaking research to investigate how brain cells alter the diameter of brain blood vessels under normal conditions and in disease models where blood flow is reduced. He has discovered that the oxygen level in the brain is a critical factor that dictates whether brain cells speed up or slow down blood flow. This finding has increased understanding of the energy-related signals the brain uses to match blood flow with nutrient demand.Gordon’s research to better understand how brain cells cause normal and abnormal changes to brain blood vessel diameters could lead to the development of effective treatments for a range of brain health problems caused by poor blood flow.

Dr. Shaylih Muehlmann, Canada Research Chair in Language, Culture and the Environment, is analyzing how such conflicts are often as much about who gets access and rights to water as they are about struggles over class hierarchy, language politics and the definition of particular identity categories.Muehlmann is examining water disputes in the region around the Colorado River in northern Mexico, which has historically been dominated by agriculture and fishing. The river used to run from the US Rocky Mountains to the Gulf of California, but in recent decades has rarely made it past the international border because of extensive overdevelopment upstream. Muehlmann is exploring distinct yet interrelated strategies that locals in the Colorado River Delta have used to respond to environmental displacement and state restrictions on their use of the river. Environmental marginalization often obscures and reinforces other kinds of inequalities, such as gender, language and class hierarchies. At the same time, environmental conflict can become the catalyst by which these inequalities become visible and contested. Muehlmann’s empirical analysis of environmental marginalization and structural violence on the United States-Mexico border will help shape a theoretical approach to the analysis of identity formation amid conflicts over such natural resources as water.

Socio-economic progress is strongly dependent on our capability to efficiently process all this information. Most systems that carry out this tremendous task use electronic circuits at their core, but this approach is becoming more inefficient as the amount of data to be handled increases dramatically. There are intrinsic processing speed (or bandwidth) limitations associated with electronics. Dr. José Azaña, Canada Research Chair in Ultrafast Photonic Signal Processing, is seeking solutions to this critical problem by using photonic technologies—methods based on the use of light waves or photons, instead of electrons. Photonics can potentially offer bandwidths in orders of magnitude larger than electronic technologies. Complex information-processing functionalities can be created in electronics by combining a set of a few fundamental signal-processing elements like building blocks.

This cellular dysfunction can result in cognitive deficts and motor abnormalites. Several neurological diseases, including Parkinson, Alzheimer and Huntington disease and stroke, occur as a result of a neurodegenerative process. The prevalence of these neurodegenerative disorders is increasing dramatically as people are living longer, and now affect millions of people worldwide.Interestingly, research now shows there are a number of similar mechanisms involved in these disorders at the cellular level, which suggests that common treatments may be of benefit for some neurological diseases. Dr. Rona Graham, Canada Research Chair in Neurodegenerative Diseases, is studying how proteins involved in cell death pathways are regulated with aging and how they may be altered during the development of neurodegenerative diseases.The activation of caspases—proteins involved in cell death—and cleavage of particular proteins is critical in the development of several neurodegenerative diseases. Research indicates activation of caspase-6, a type of molecular scissors, occurs early in the neurodegenerative process. Importantly, its activation has been observed in preclinical Alzheimer’s and Huntington’s diseased brains. Graham is exploring the biology of caspase-6 and other caspases to develop successful treatments to slow or prevent nerve cell atrophy. This knowledge will provide valuable new insights into the mechanisms involved in neurodegenerative diseases and provide a greatly-needed understanding of the crucial factors that determine caspase regulation. The overall goal of Graham’s research is to outline the critical, common steps involved in the development of neurological diseases and help identify treatments that could delay or prevent brain degeneration.

The ability of these pathogens to take refuge within host cells contributes greatly to their virulence. This strategy enables them to evade detection and destruction by the host immune system. Once the parasites access a host cell, they rely on highly developed mechanisms for survival that make clearing infections extremely difficult, if not impossible. Thus preventing apicomplexan parasites from accessing the protective environment of host cells is central to controlling their spread. Dr. Martin Boulanger, Canada Research Chair in Molecular Interactions and Structural Biology, seeks to better understand the molecular mechanisms that apicomplexan parasites use. He is concentrating on organisms responsible for the parasitic disease toxoplasmosis and malaria, which initially engage and ultimately invade host cells. To achieve this goal, he is using biophysical techniques such as X-ray crystallography (a method to determine the arrangements of atoms within a crystal) to generate high-resolution, 3-D maps of proteins known to play a crucial role in virulence. Boulanger’s research will improve knowledge of the molecular strategies employed by apicomplexa to establish host infections. This research is crucial to understanding the virulence and transmissibility of these globally devastating pathogens. Boulanger’s research will also provide valuable insights into the general survival mechanisms of intracellular pathogens, and will directly support the design of new treatments, ranging from small inhibitory molecules to engineered vaccines.

In these cases, antibodies become biological missiles called auto-antibodies that attack our own cells and organs. There are many of these auto-antibody-producing diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis and connective tissue diseases like lupus, systemic sclerosis and overlapping connective tissue diseases.SARDs are associated with even worse diseases in younger women, with increased morbidity and premature mortality. Current treatments for SARDS are limited and do not sufficiently address the chronic pain, fatigue, depression and organ damage associated with these diseases.Dr. Paul R. Fortin, Canada Research Chair in Systemic Autoimmune Rheumatic Diseases, has been working to better understand the bio-psycho-social impact of chronic rheumatic diseases associated with SARDs. He is particularly interested in developing multidimensional preventive and therapeutic interventions to empower SARDs patients and help them better navigate their journeys from illness to wellness.

",Exploring the Power Station of the Cell," Exploring the Power Station of the Cell Almost all of the fuel that drives life is generated through the combustion of sugar and fat within the mitochondria, often referred to as the “energy powerhouse” of the cell. As with other furnaces, this combustion process results in cellular smoke in the form of reactive chemicals that can damage surrounding lipids and proteins. The inability of mitochondria to remove damaged proteins and lipids can lead to cellular degeneration and is linked to the development of degenerative brain diseases like Parkinson’s, Huntington’s and Alzheimer’s and more rare diseases. Cell biologists have recently discovered that mitochondria act together as an interconnected network, fusing together and breaking apart in an unexpectedly dynamic and orchestrated way. Dr. Heidi McBride, Canada Research Chair in Mitochondrial Cell Biology, is playing an important role in uncovering additional insights into how mitochondria behave within cells and how their activity is controlled. McBride is focusing on expanding basic understanding of mitochondria behaviour and on applying her findings to neurodegenerative and heart disease, metabolic syndromes (disorders that increase the risk of developing heart disease and diabetes) and cancer. She is working to manipulate mitochondrial behavior in certain diseases and to determine whether some diseases can be prevented or even cured with the identification of new treatment targets.

Medulloblastoma, the most common malignant primary childhood brain cancer, often leads to the spread of cancer cells to other tissues. Treating it is complex because there are four different types of medulloblastoma, and each has a unique genetic makeup and responds differently to current therapies. The main treatments available today—chemotherapy and radiation—are very hard on young children’s developing brains. As Canada Research Chair in Neuro-Oncology and Human Stem Cells, Dr. Tamra Werbowetski-Ogilvie aims to find new treatments for each type of medulloblastoma by characterizing the cells that control growth in cancer stem cells, as well as in tumor cells that move or metastasize to other parts of the body. Werbowetski-Ogilvie and her research team are identifying new ways to diagnose and treat these often-fatal cancers by shedding light on the importance of the proteins OTX2 and CD271/p75NTR in how medulloblastoma forms and progresses. They are also determining how these proteins function and testing whether agents that target them suppress the growth of human medulloblastomas implanted into mice. In addition, they are determining whether the presence of these proteins in tumors helps with diagnosis or with finding effective treatments. By identifying the proteins that help the tumors “grow or go,” Werbowetski-Ogilvie’s findings will establish a cellular “fingerprint” that can be used to develop new therapies to kill the cancer cells (while sparing normal cells) and improve quality of life for children with the disease.

Dr. Gary Hinshaw, Canada Research Chair in Observational Cosmology, seeks to answer these and other profound questions as he studies the physical universe and our place in it.We had only rough answers to those questions a few decades ago. Now, thanks to precise data from an array of high-technology instruments, we presently understand the age of the universe to be 13.75 billion years. We know its contents are dominated by dark matter and dark energy. To the best of our knowledge, the universe is infinite and will continue expanding forever at an ever-faster rate. Hinshaw is now using radio telescopes to address two outstanding enigmas in cosmology: Did cosmic inflation really occur? And what is the nature of the dark energy that dominates the universe?Cosmic inflation purports that an extremely rapid, exponential expansion of the universe took place in a tremendous burst of growth powered by vacuum energy. Although current evidence for inflation is only circumstantial, new observations could change that. Dark energy is arguably the biggest enigma in physics today, and the only way to measure it is to observe its effect on the cosmos as a whole, since its effects near Earth are nearly imperceptible.Hinshaw’s research will shed new light on the origin and fate of our entire cosmos.

But what if a pill could be taken before every meal that would neutralize the gut-damaging effects of gluten intolerance? Dr. Elena Verdú, Canada Research Chair in Inflammation, Microbiota and Nutrition, thinks it’s just a matter of time before such a pill is developed. Verdú is researching the mechanisms involved in food intolerance in functional gut disorders to shed light on the role gluten intolerance plays in the development of diseases like celiac disease and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Verdú has performed gluten sensitivity studies that show that gluten can set off a reaction in the intestines and the immune system, even in people who don't have celiac disease. She has also tested the efficacy of a process to prevent gluten’s toxic effect on the gut lining. Although this approach is still in a pre-clinical discovery phase, it could allow much greater diet freedom for people with celiac disease and gluten-sensitive IBS. Verdú’s work to unravel the mystery of how gluten causes damage and dysfunction to the gut could lead to greatly improved non-dietary treatment and prevention strategies for people with gluten intolerance.

They choose different fields of study in school and gravitate toward different careers. But what’s less clear is why. There have been suggestions these differences reflect the way society points women toward certain choices and sometimes discriminates against them. Others suggest that sex differences are biological. Dr. Michael Baker, Canada Research Chair in Economics, Child Development and Public Policy, is charting a new path on this issue. Baker is leading a comprehensive study of environmental and developmental inputs that are provided to young children by their gender. He will then relate these differences to cognitive, behavioural and economic outcomes for these same children later in life. The aim is to determine whether children are being provided with different environments and, if so, whether these differences matter in how they fare down the line.Baker is also exploring whether the relationship between early childhood developmental delays and cognitive, behavioural and economic achievement at older ages differs according to family income and socioeconomic status. The benefits of early childhood education for disadvantaged children are well-known, but it is not known whether these benefits also accrue to more advantaged children. Baker’s research could have major implications for investment in and design of early childhood education programs.

Their institutional literacy programs shaped the cultural initiatives of New Brunswick and the entire country.Tremblay is investigating the social factors that came together to create the conditions for what Bailey described as “a discharge of creative energy.” He is asking such questions as: Where did these three figures find precedent for their reform? Was avant-garde modernism as crucial to their sense of renewal as it was to modernists elsewhere in Canada? And how did they adapt continental modernism to encourage a more localized “cosmopolitan regionalism,” which marked Canadian literature’s coming of age?Tremblay will look at how a cultural program is galvanized, gathers momentum and morphs into related forms. His study of modernism in New Brunswick, particularly its bicultural features in Canada’s only bilingual province, will broaden pre-existing views of modernism that saw it as monolithic and central Canadian.

Given the flourishing market for complementary and alternative medicines in Canada, these foods and drugs are become a routine part of our daily consumption. Dr. Carla Nappi, Canada Research Chair in Early Modern Studies, is exploring how materials that we now consume like ginseng, quinine and even water first came to be translated and understood in a multi-ethnic and multi-linguistic China. That pre-modern China had its own market for alternative and complementary medicines from different cultures.Nappi also aims to understand how recipes, dictionaries, images, sensations and translation manuals in multiple languages shaped how bodies were experienced, manipulated and understood in China from the 15th through 19th centuries. Nappi’s research also involves an investigation of how knowledge of medical substances and associated recipes were disseminated by the Chinese, Manchu, Mongolian and Tibetan languages. As part of her research, Nappi is exploring the mechanics of official translation bureaus at the Ming and Qing courts. In addition, she is looking at pre-modern scientific and medical exchanges between Chinese and Islamic cultures. Nappi’s research will increase knowledge about the growing consumption of traditional Chinese medicine in Canada.

However, studies suggest that most Canadians are not consuming adequate levels of omega-3 fatty acids to reap their benefits. Making matters worse, dietary reporting of omega-3 consumption often becomes inaccurate when people are aware their health and eating habits are being scrutinized.So how can we determine that we’re getting enough omega-3 fatty acids? Dr. Ken Stark, Canada Research Chair in Nutritional Lipidomics, can provide the answer with just one drop of blood. Stark has developed a rapid and cost effective technique to profile the fatty acid in blood that can also decipher what people have been eating. In addition, Stark is investigating how the body processes omega-3 fats. He has also found that Canadian women have higher blood levels of DHA, one of the omega-3 fatty acids found in fish. His research suggests that women are not necessarily eating more DHA, but that women are better than men at converting plant-based omega-3 fatty acid linolenic acid, found in flaxseed, to DHA which has a greater effect on heart and brain health.Stark’s research on fatty acid profiling could be used for routine clinical screening to assess dietary habits and disease risk. It will also improve understanding of the metabolism of omega-3 fatty acids, thus leading to better dietary recommendations and better health outcomes. "

The planet’s health and the global economy are dependent on finding new ways to generate and use energy without impacting the climate.Dr. Dwight Seferos, Canada Research Chair in Polymer Nanomaterials, is at the forefront of the quest to create new materials that could revolutionize the way we collect and store the sun’s energy. Seferos is leading a series of projects to develop new materials for electronics, and to test their performance in solar cells and as storage devices such as batteries and capacitors.The new materials are prepared in a manner that is similar to what is used by the plastics and pharmaceutical industries. These new materials can be easily produced and, like paint, can be coated onto surfaces. They also have the potential to vastly improve the way we collect and store energy by lowering manufacturing costs. If everything works out, the new materials will replace the silicon semiconductors currently used in electronics, which are heavy and expensive to manufacture, install and repair. However, the structures and properties of these new materials are not ideal as they are presently not as good at generating energy as silicon semiconductors. Seferos is working to improve the efficiency of these new materials at converting light into energy. Seferos’ research could lead to the creation of cheap, clean and more accessible energy to help power our increasing energy demands. "

","Making Math as Easy as 1,2,3 "," Making Math as Easy as 1,2,3 Basic calculation skills are essential in today’s world. In fact, research suggests that numerical skills are an even stronger predictor of school success than reading abilities. About five per cent of the population suffers from developmental dyscalculia—a specific difficulty to acquire even the most basic arithmetic skills, such as the ability to add 5 + 4 quickly. Studies have shown that people with below average numerical and mathematical skills are more likely to commit crimes and suffer illness. Despite the clear importance of mathematical abilities and the substantial societal cost incurred by low numeracy skills, little research has been conducted on the development of mathematical skills and the origins of math disabilities. That is in clear contrast to the huge number of studies that have been conducted on reading disabilities.Dr. Daniel Ansari, Canada Research Chair in Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience, aims to fill this glaring knowledge gap by studying how children develop basic number skills from an early age. Ansari is using both behavioural and neuroimaging methods to study the predictors of successful math learning. His research is linking basic number processing with the learning of arithmetic. He is also uncovering the roles played by the brain during this process.Ansari’s research will lead to better understanding of the root causes of math difficulties and develop tools to accurately diagnose and treat math problems in children.

",Caring for the Caregivers ," Caring for the Caregivers Our aging population has resulted in increased numbers of Canadians who are involved in the care of loved ones with chronic medical or mental illness. This caregiving activity can be time-intensive and long-lasting, and can create significant economic, social, psychological and physical burdens for families. Studies have associated prolonged caregiving with greater risks for psychological and physical illness. Dr. Jean-Philippe Gouin, Canada Research Chair in Chronic Stress and Health, aims to improve understanding of caregiving so that effective interventions can be developed to reduce its burden. Gouin is examining the psychosocial factors that can either increase or decrease stress faced by caregivers. These include the quality of interpersonal relationships, health behaviours such as exercise and sleep, and the use of community support services. Gouin is also looking into the biological factors that are involved in the negative impact of caregiving stress on health. Indeed, chronic psychological stress can interfere with the activity of the immune system, leading to excess inflammation. While inflammation is an essential immune response to acute infection and injury, overproduction of markers of inflammation increases the risk for poor health outcomes. Gouin is identifying how caregiving-related changes in cardiovascular, hormonal and immune function lead to the overproduction of inflammatory markers and increase the risk for poor health. Gouin’s research will improve the quality of life for Canadian caregivers by helping to develop ways to reduce the negative psychological and biological consequences associated with chronic caregiving stress.

",This research will help scientists develop drugs or vaccines to stop the proliferation of  bacterial pathogens.     ,Preventing bacteria from causing disease," Preventing bacteria from causing disease Bacteria are tiny, living organisms that play many roles in the environment. In their quest for survival and nutrition, many bacteria aid in the decomposition of dead leaves, wood, animals and also garbage. They inject nutrients into soil helping trees and other organisms grow. Similarly, bacteria in our gut helps to digest foods and we also use bacteria to make foods such as yogurt. Of course, aside from these beneficial characteristics, bacteria can also cause disease. Understanding how bacteria work—for good or bad—is the focus of Dr. Trevor Moraes, Canada Research Chair in Structural Biology of Membrane Proteins. Moraes is concentrating on membrane proteins and their roles in allowing bacteria to cause illnesses such as sepsis, pneumonias, bacterial meningitis and E. coli poisoning. Membrane proteins are associated with the biological cell membrane that separates the interior of all cells from the outside environment. They play essential roles in allowing all cells to communicate, get nutrients and, thus, grow. Moraes aims to understand how membrane proteins function at the molecular level to transport molecules within these biological membranes. To visualize membrane proteins in detail, Moraes is using technology that creates 3-D structural representations of them. This will help determine how nutrient transport works. Bacterial pathogens are responsible for nearly 250,000 health-care-associated infections in Canada annually. Moraes’s research will help reduce deaths associated with bacterial infections. It will also lead to dramatically lower health-care costs by helping scientists develop drugs that can specifically target and inhibit membrane proteins within pathogenic bacteria and, thereby, inhibit their ability to cause disease.

Among these are mental illnesses such as depression and anxiety disorders, in which stress is an underlying factor.Dr. Matthew Hill, Canada Research Chair in Neurobiology of Stress, aims to understand how stress gets under our skin and into our brains. One mechanism he has identified is the involvement of stress with the endocannabinoid system—natural compounds in the brain that are similar to the active ingredient in marijuana. Hill has shown that the endocannabinoid system is crucial, under normal conditions to our ability to recover from and adapt to stressful situations. However, following chronic exposure to stress the endocannabinoid system becomes compromised, and the loss of this natural buffer system results in stress systems in the brain becoming more sensitized. This sensitization occurs through nerve growth within regions of the brain, such as the amygdala, that promote anxiety-like behaviour and make it easier to release stress hormones such as cortisol. Hill has also found that people with stress-related mental illnesses, like depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, have lower endocannabinoids levels. Hill now aims to find whether the endocannabinoid system represents a viable target for the development of a new class of drugs for the treatment of stress-related mood and anxiety disorders. Hill’s research could result in new treatments for the growing epidemic of mental illnesses in our society. "

Another problem is that the extraction of oil sands deposits is one of the least environmentally friendly forms of petroleum extraction. This is a major concern, given the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Figuring out a way to get at additional oil sands deposits could also translate into hundreds of billions of dollars more in gross domestic product. Dr. Josephine Hill, Canada Research Chair in Hydrogen and Catalysis, is working to develop new and environmentally responsible technologies that use catalysts for the extraction of oil sands resources. Catalysts are substances that speed up chemical reactions. They can also minimize production of the unwanted byproducts generated by a reaction. The effects of catalysts are seen in many places—from the enzymes in saliva, which are catalysts in digestion, to the catalytic converters in car tailpipes, which control vehicle emissions.Catalysts can also help remove unwanted metals and sulfur in the oil sands, while improving the ability of the oil to flow (that is, catalysts reduce the viscosity of the oil). In addition, catalysts are used to produce a source of cost-effective, environmentally friendly hydrogen with which to refine this vast but unconventional, energy source.Oil prices and technology will eventually reach levels where it will become both possible and desirable to reach the remaining energy locked deep in Alberta's oil sands. When that day comes, Hill's research will help us tap this huge resource in an environmentally friendly and cost-effective way. "

The worldwide societal cost of dementia is estimated at $600 billion. With the cause and underlying mechanisms leading to Alzheimer's disease still undefined, the world is facing a dementia epidemic. No definitive early diagnostic marker has been found and there are no effective disease-modifying treatments for Alzheimer's.Dr. Weihong Song, Canada Research Chair in Alzheimer's Disease, helped discover that hypoxia (deprivation of adequate oxygen supply) facilitates Alzheimer's disease development—the first time stroke was linked to the disease. Song showed that the epilepsy drug valproate may be able to prevent Alzheimer's disease and improve memory deficits. His work also demonstrated that genetic defects contribute to Alzheimer's disease in Down syndrome patients. Song is now conducting innovative and crucial studies to identify the molecular mechanisms involved in the cause of dementia. In addition, he is working to discover new biomarkers (indicators of diseases) and drug targets for Alzheimer's disease.Song's research could lead to ground-breaking discoveries that will help shape the future of dementia research and prevent an epidemic of Alzheimer's disease.

These disorders increase risk for other causes of illness and death, including chronic conditions like cardiovascular disease. Mental disorders are also associated with enormous social and economic costs. Clearly, there can be no health without mental health. Dr. Arijit Nandi, Canada Research Chair in Political Economy of Global Health, is researching the widespread effects of social and economic policies and economic factors on mental health outcomes.While treatment interventions are one way to improve mental health, such interventions on a large-scale may be ineffective. On average, less than one-quarter of people with mental health disorders in lower-income countries receive treatment. Nandi believes limited treatment capacity in low- and middle-income countries suggests a preventative approach that focuses on the social determinants of mental disorders should complement clinical approaches.Evidence from high-income countries implies that economic factors such as unemployment may drive risk for mental health disorders. However, few studies have examined the association between economic policies, macroeconomic factors and global mental health. Nandi is aiming to fill this research gap.Nandi’s research will help guide interventions for improving population health and reducing global socioeconomic inequalities in health. "

From the clothes we wear to the tools we use, we are so accustomed to adapting by inventing that we often forget the animal world operates differently. Animals that face big changes cannot simply invent something new. Their only ""tool"" is their genetic code. If these genetic codes are diverse, they can adapt. But if they lack diversity, it can mean trouble for those animals, and perhaps for the entire species.Dr. Nusha Keyghobadi, Canada Research Chair in Molecular Ecology and Landscape Genetics, is examining how changes to habitats can erode genetic diversity.When we pass a clear-cut forest, we see obvious effects of human intervention on the wild. What we often do not realize is that these visible changes lead to even bigger long-term changes. Shrinking habitats push animals into smaller and more isolated zones, potentially leading to the loss of genetic diversity. If the climate warms, animals may no longer be equipped to adapt. The habitat loss will have left them with a too limited genetic pool.Keyghobadi aims to understand the nature and scope of these genetic changes. She is using butterflies, mosquitoes and other insects to identify the key habitat factors that contribute to genetic diversity in animal populations.Keyghobadi's research will help to minimize the effects of our hunger for land, and to identify best practices to maintain genetic diversity in animal populations, before they go the way of the dodo.

This genetic information specifies such factors as how the bacteria will interact with their surroundings, and their resistance to antibiotics. At the same time, our human immune system has evolved to combat bacterial invaders by attacking bacteria where they like to live—in our cells and tissues. This cellular warfare can give rise to diseases like inflammatory bowel disease, which affects one in every 160 Canadians.Dr. Brian Coombes, Canada Research Chair in Infectious Disease Pathogenesis, is exploring the genetics and molecular development of human and animal infectious diseases, focusing on where pathogenic bacteria meet the host's defense system. He is focusing on why some people are more susceptible to food-borne infections from intestinal pathogens like Salmonella and E. coli, and on how these pathogens can lead to increased risk for developing of chronic gastrointestinal disorders. Since many of these pathogens are transmitted through water, vegetables and domesticated animals, his research could have major public health repercussions. Coombes has already found that certain types of E. coli that are linked to inflammatory bowel disease contain unique genetic material. This genetic material may allow these bacteria to colonize the gastrointestinal tract and evade the body’s immune system.Coombes’ research on bacterial development mechanisms will increase understanding of how these bacteria contribute to chronic diseases. It could also lead to ways in which to limit our exposure to them by eradicating harmful bacteria from our food and water. "

We hold our tongues when a colleague angers us, we pass up the donut at the office party, we get up early to exercise, and we save for retirement instead of buying the latest technology. Yet, we also often fail to do these things—we lash out, we take another donut for the road, we hit the snooze button one more time, and we tell ourselves we can start saving tomorrow. Our failure to manage these challenges successfully is far from trivial. In fact, the leading causes of death in North America are due to modifiable behaviours involving self-regulation.

Champagne is developing more environmentally benign extraction processes for the recovery and generation of bio-based products. She is doing so by using biomass and residual biomass (biological material from living or recently-living organisms). The use of biomass feedstocks (crops that can be used as substitutes for fossil fuels) is limited by advances in conversion technologies and biomass supply rather than by demand. Establishing a future supply of green and sustainable bio-based products also requires technologies that are more environmentally friendly than is currently the case. Progress will increasingly rely on finding innovative ways to extract bio-based products and on the development of green processes to recover, reuse and provide value to process solvents, byproducts and waste streams. Champagne is exploring the development of a number of approaches for the use of biomass for environmental applications. She is also working to develop sustainable processes to extract bio-oil from microalgae and to recover bioenergy and biofuels from waste biomass.

But the cost of this progress has been high. There are about 30,000 chemically contaminated sites around the country, and each is a potential threat to human and environmental health. Because of poor disposal methods or accidental leaks, the soil at these former industrial sites now contains a toxic soup of chemicals. These include gasoline and oil, industrial by products such as solvents, and even a few banned substances like PCBs. Many of these chemicals are suspected or known carcinogens, making groundwater that flows through the contaminated sites unusable and potentially dangerous. Using current techniques, it would cost tens of billions of dollars to clean up all of Canada’s contaminated sites, not including associated costs such as health care. Dr. Jason Gerhard, Canada Research Chair in Geoenvironmental Restoration Engineering, is developing a wider array of practical strategies and cost-effective technologies to eliminate hazardous chemicals in the soil.

",Reducing Eye Injections by Using Nanoparticles ," Reducing Eye Injections by Using Nanoparticles It is only natural that, as people get older, they have to squint to read the latest message on their smart phone. However, some age-related eye conditions are more serious. Untreated macular degeneration and diabetes retinopathy, for example, can lead to blindness. Although an injection directly into the eye can keep these diseases in check, it has to be repeated every three months, because the eye is extremely efficient at clearing away drugs. Dr. Frank Gu, Canada Research Chair in Advanced Targeted Delivery Systems, aims to dramatically reduce the frequency of eye injections by packaging the drugs in nanoparticles designed to target the affected cells. Once the cells are targeted, the particles can slowly release their payload, greatly increasing the effectiveness of each treatment. But how do you keep the nanoparticles in place long enough to do their job? Gu has seen the light. He has developed a process that involves shining a light with a particular wavelength into the patient’s eye after the injection. This prompts the nanoparticles to clump around the diseased cells, forming a mass that is too big to pass through the sieve of the eye’s capillaries. Once the nanoparticles have dispensed their drugs, shining a different wavelength of light will break up the clumps, leaving particles small enough to exit the eye. Gu’s research with nanoparticles could lead to dramatically improved treatments for people with age-related eye conditions. "

",How to Prevent Low-back Pain," How to Prevent Low-back Pain Low-back injuries are a major social and economic issue for Canadians and for industrial productivity. It is a condition that affects about 80 per cent of people at some point in their lives, and results in a huge amount of work absences and loss of enjoyment of life. The lower back is the body’s most frequently injured area and injury to it is considered by the World Health Organization, one of the top three occupational health problems.Everyday tasks such as prolonged standing or sitting have been linked to low-back pain, yet there has been little research on how these common sedentary exposures cause injury. Cumulative (or repetitive) loading also appears to be a likely cause for back injuries that are not identifiable with a single event. But, once again, scant research has been done to define the biological pathways of pain development through exposure to accumulated loading on the low back. Dr. Jack Callaghan, Canada Research Chair in Spine Biomechanics and Injury Prevention, is examining lumbar spine tissues and is conducting human studies to understand how exposure to a variety of factors initiate and exacerbate low-back injuries. He will then develop methods to assess daily loading on the back and to set workplace exposure limits as preventative measures. Callaghan’s research will lead to improved treatment for existing low-back pain sufferers, and will improve workplace standards for preventing low-back injuries. "

One innovation that is increasingly being used in civil aircraft is lighter-than-metal composite materials. Another is shot peening—a process that modifies the mechanical properties of metals, which can extend the lives of some metallic parts by 20 times. However, the Canadian aerospace industry lacks the scientific and technical skills to fully integrate these advanced materials in the design process. Materials failure and damage mechanisms are immensely complex phenomena. Defects at the atomic scale can lead to small cracks, which can develop into larger cracks and ultimately lead to catastrophic failure. As the service life of materials is driven by a broad spectrum of factors that can occur over time, a number of approaches must be developed to take all of them into account. Dr. Martin Lévesque, Canada Research Chair in Multiscale Modelling of Advanced Aerospace Materials, is developing and testing new models to evaluate the mechanical response of advanced materials used in the aerospace industry. Lévesque is focusing his efforts on predicting the long-term response of composites in service conditions. He is also predicting the effects of shot peening on metal fatigue and developing cost-effective and innovative procedures to test materials under complex load and environmental conditions. The models Lévesque develops will allow the Canadian aerospace industry to design lighter and safer aircraft parts that will consume less fuel and require less energy to be manufactured, thus decreasing the environmental footprint of air travel.

This technology has already brought us numerous industrial products in recent decades, ranging from medications to polymers. Micro-organisms such as bacteria play a key role in biotechnology in many production processes requiring the use of microbial fermentation technology. However, the technological and economic success of biotechnology depends increasingly on improving production efficiency, in particular, on faster development and reduced process development costs. Microbial fermentation—the mixture of science, technology and art that is needed to convert discoveries into bioprocesses and bio-products—is critical to many industrial biotech processes. Solid attention has to be paid to microbial fermentation process development in order to meet stringent requirements that affect quantity and quality of the product, as well as reliability of the production process used.Dr. Denis Groleau, Canada Research Chair in Micro-organisms and Industrial Processes, is examining how microbial fermentation process development can be accelerated through biological and analytical approaches. He aims to design and better control microbial fermentation processes that will be used in biopharmaceutical biotechnology and in other biotechnology sectors, to increase the efficiency and profitability of this kind of production. This will reduce development costs and increase the probability of creating new industrial applications for discoveries made in basic research.Groleau is focusing not only on high volume products with low value but also on low volume products with high value, which are difficult to produce at large scales but account for much of the potential future of the pharmaceutical industry.Groleau’s research will reduce costs associated with process and product development and increase the success rate of Canadian biotech firms.

These common oral diseases represent a major global health problem and an enormous financial burden for public health. Not only do they cause pain, but they affect important aspects of life, such as eating. Less common oral diseases—like oral cancer—are life threatening, while gum disease has been linked to obesity, diabetes and coronary heart disease.For most of the 20th century, scientists linked chronic oral diseases with current circumstances such as socioeconomic status and health behaviours. But could past circumstances over people’s life course make them more vulnerable to developing specific diseases?Dr. Belinda Nicolau, Canada Research Chair in Life Course Oral Epidemiology, has pioneered the use of the life, course framework in the field of oral health. Her work suggests that not only current circumstances, but also social and psychological environments at the beginning of life have an impact on chronic oral diseases.

Most patients follow similar treatment programs, which include a broad range of drugs and psychotherapy. These one-size- fits-all treatments are not always effective. It is important to identify the underlying biology of psychiatric disease so that appropriate, personalized treatments can be designed. Emerging evidence suggests that mutated genes may be responsible for many psychiatric disorders, but that mutations in many different genes can lead to highly similar symptoms.

Dr. Scott Schieman, Canada Research Chair in the Social Contexts of Health, has long been interested in how stress creeps up in the intersection between home and work. He is now asking and answering questions about the complex relationships between job status, family roles, stress and health in the Internet era.Schieman is using data from a survey of 6,000 workers as part of a long-term effort to follow a population for a decade and beyond. He will test and advance theories that describe the social and health consequences of the blurring boundaries between work and home. Consider the example of job authority. Previous research suggests that many people seek out jobs that give them authority. However, evidence suggests that job authority doesn’t actually benefit health. Schieman will investigate this paradox by testing whether the stressors of a job with lots of authority—like more pressures, interpersonal conflict and work-family conflict—outweigh the rewards and create a net negative effect on health. He calls this “the stress of higher status.” Schieman is also interested in uncovering how gender, age, race and social class make a difference in the complex dance between stress and health.Schieman’s research will yield practical information for workers, employers and policy-makers who seek to improve health and reduce work-life stress.

",Glaciers as Imprints of Climate Change ," Glaciers as Imprints of Climate Change Climate change and glacier retreat pose a critical threat to mountain and coastal communities worldwide, as freshwater resources dwindle and sea levels rise. One sixth of the global population relies on its freshwater needs from ice stored in glaciers on land. Accelerated melting of these glaciers transfers freshwater stores from the land to the ocean, driving up sea levels. Ice loss has increased over the past decade, due in part to the dramatic thinning and retreat of glaciers that terminate in the ocean. Poor understanding of the complex behaviour of glaciers and their vulnerability to ongoing ocean and atmospheric warming limit the ability of researchers to predict future sea levels. Identifying the sensitivity of glaciers to climate variations is critical to predicting change in the coming century and to adapting to that change. Dr. Michele Koppes, Canada Research Chair in Landscapes of Climate Change, is aiming to understand how glaciers reflect climate and drive landscape change. She is also studying the impact of glaciers on water resources. Koppes is using field observations of glacier dynamics and glacial sediments in a range of climate regimes to test, refine and verify new models that integrate climate, ice dynamics, oceanography and landscape evolution.

To answer this question, scientists need to understand more about the function of the almost 20,000 genes we each have in every cell in our bodies. The high-profile Human Genome Project mapped the genome. But the next frontier—functional genomics—will improve understanding of what is actually done by all its component parts. Dr. Jason Moffat, Canada Research Chair in Functional Genomics of Cancer, is increasing knowledge of cancer by cataloguing the genes that are essential for cancer to grow and flourish. His research is already yielding new information about specific types of cancer including breast, pancreatic and ovarian. Cancer is a disease of the genome. Often, when a genetic mutation associated with cancer is seen, its functional significance remains unknown. In other words, it’s not known how cancer results from altered genetic activity. The precise combinations of genetic alterations that give rise to a tumour determine how it will behave. The result of these alterations can be a disruption in the signalling networks that cells use to communicate with each other and sense their environment. This can be good news: if communication mechanisms aren’t working properly, cancer cells are potentially left vulnerable, creating opportunities for us to go after them. Moffat’s research will help identify new cancer cell vulnerabilities, increase understanding of how cancer begins and, ultimately, aid in developing tools to help diagnose and treat cancer. "

It is estimated that more than one million medication errors (such as the wrong drug or dosage) and near misses (errors that are caught before the error reaches the patient) occur annually in Canadian community pharmacies.Dr. Todd Boyle, Canada Research Chair in Quality Assurance in Community Pharmacy, is aiming to change this situation by creating a dialogue about medication errors—a difficult and often taboo subject in community pharmacy practice.Despite the frequency of medication errors—collectively known as quality related events (QREs)—and their potential implications to pharmacies and the public, under-reporting is high. Under-reporting of QREs represents a lost learning opportunity for stakeholders to take steps to reduce the likelihood of similar ones repeating. Boyle is exploring how community pharmacies can learn from their mistakes to improve overall levels of patient safety. He is also examining why QREs are reported or not reported in community pharmacies. As well, Boyle is developing a standardized quality improvement program for enhanced QRE reporting and learning in pharmacies. This will be followed by an assessment of the long-term impact of quality assurance programs on QRE reporting and learning and patient safety.Pharmacy staff will sometimes make mistakes.

","The Potential of DNA’s Silent Partner, RNA"," The Potential of DNA’s Silent Partner, RNA We are all a mass of proteins. Everything in our body—from hair, eyes and bone to muscle and organs—is comprised of protein. The protein is created by DNA, the molecule that contains our genetic instructions. But the ability for genes to create the protein requires a lesser-known component called ribonucleic acid, or RNA for short. Dr. Julie Claycomb, Canada Research Chair in Small RNA Biology, likens the process to baking a cake. Our DNA is the recipe for the cake. The protein is the finished product, a tasty, fully baked cake, while RNA is the intermediate mix of ingredients listed in the recipe that have the potential to be turned into a lovely dessert. The RNA that acts as the DNA’s intermediary is called messenger RNA. Researchers recently discovered smaller RNA pieces that interfere with messenger RNA (called short interfering RNAs, or siRNAs) and disable the ability of genes to create protein (in a process known as RNA interference, or RNAi). This misregulation can lead to cancer, infertility or conditions such as Down’s syndrome.Claycomb is working to unravel the means by which siRNAs can stop genes from creating proteins, and is pursuing a fascinating possibility: If the process of RNAi can normally stop a messenger RNA from producing a protein, could it be exploited to target and silence mis-expressed genes in a cancer cell? Claycomb is trying to find the answers by using C. elegans, a one-millimetre long roundworm found in soil that has proven remarkably effective in RNAi research.Claycomb’s research has strong potential over the next five to 10 years to be translated into new treatment approaches for a number of complex diseases.

But that hasn’t stopped scientists from tapping this weak force. Specialists in the modern field of optomechanics, which studies the effects of electromagnetic radiation on mechanical motion, are learning to use laser light to control the motion of certain solid objects. Dr. Jack Childress, Canada Research Chair in Experimental Optomechanics, is combining state-of-the-art optical systems with high-quality mechanical systems. This allows an incredibly weak source of light — even one that is a million times dimmer than a keychain LED — to profoundly influence the motion of an object large enough to see with our eyes and hold in our fingers. Perhaps surprisingly, light can control the motion of objects ranging from kilogram-scale mirrors that hang in gravitational wave detectors to nanoscopic-scale mechanical systems that are manufactured on microchips. The intensity and frequency of light can be used to tune the mechanical characteristics of such devices. Childress’s research could lead to the development of new optically-controlled mechanical devices in which the solid, flexible support structures are replaced entirely by photons.

Industrial production systems that provide much of the world’s food use large amounts of water and energy, and are major contributors to biodiversity loss, soil erosion, chemical exposure and climate change. These problems not only endanger environmental sustainability, but future food security as well. However, despite widespread recognition of the need for environmentally sustainable food production, incorporation of environmental sustainability goals into global food security governance arrangements has been weak and uneven. Dr. Jennifer Clapp, Canada Research Chair in Global Food Security and Sustainability, aims to improve understanding of the links between environmental sustainability and global food security governance. Clapp is analyzing how environmental considerations interact with international food security governance arrangements in such areas as agricultural investment assistance in developing countries, measures to address high food prices, and rules governing international food trade.Clapp’s research will help policy-makers shed light on the complex political and economic forces that foster or hinder global co-operation for sustainable food security.

But while researchers have made significant advances in improving the success of lung transplants in recent years, serious challenges still face those waiting for a lung. Lung transplant waiting lists are increasing as the population ages. Unfortunately, 20 per cent of those on waiting lists will die before they receive a chance to receive a life-saving transplant. Dr. Marcelo Cypel, Canada Research Chair in Lung Transplantation, aims to ease this problem by increasing the availability of donor lungs and by improving the assessment and quality of donor organs. Cypel was paramount in the development of a ground-breaking technique called Normothermic Ex Vivo Lung Perfusion (EVLP) that has improved how donor lungs are assessed. Donor lungs are usually chilled and transplanted as soon as possible. But EVLP allows surgeons to keep lungs at body temperature—and functioning—during the preservation period. This allows surgeons to make more accurate assessments of the condition of the lungs, and enables surgeons to fix damaged lungs more effectively before transplantation. The result is an increase in the availability of healthy lungs for people with serious lung disease. Cypel’s EVLP research could increase the usage rates for donor lungs from today’s close to 15 per cent to about 50 per cent. This will greatly alleviate organ shortages. His research could also be of significant use for treatmenting and repairing other solid donor organs that encounter similar problems in transplantation. "

",Gene Control in Pediatric Diseases," Gene Control in Pediatric Diseases Genes play a fundamental role, as they contain information that helps make each of us who we are—what we look like, how we act, even what our talents might be. However, genes also cause many diseases and may play a role in cancer, diabetes and heart disease. Researchers are investigating how alterations or errors in fundamental processes can lead to genetic diseases in humans. New DNA sequencing technologies and advanced computational programs are being used to improve understanding of the structure and function of human genes and the genome. DNA regions that control genes are being identified and, growing fields—such as epigenetics, bioinformatics and comparative genomics—are allowing scientists to investigate complex biological phenomena on a scale that was previously impossible. Dr. Michael Wilson, Canada Research Chair in Comparative Genomics, is working at the intersections of these promising fields in order to investigate the role that regulatory mutations play in cardiovascular and other diseases. Wilson is building comparative maps of human gene regulation. These will then be used to target specific regions of the human genome for genotyping and functional testing.

","This research will reshape our understanding of brain disorders and memory loss, and could change the way these disorders are treated.",Rethinking Brain Disorders and Amnesia," Rethinking Brain Disorders and Amnesia Half a million Canadians and 35 million people worldwide live with Alzheimer’s disease or related forms of dementia. These numbers are expected to increase substantially in coming years, and they cause tremendous societal and economic burdens. Improving treatment for memory disorders requires deeper understanding of how memory is organized in healthy brains and how this organization deteriorates due to aging or brain damage. It has long been known that damage to the medial temporal lobe (MTL) of the brain causes amnesia. But it is not known how this happens.Dr. Morgan Barense, Canada Research Chair in Cognitive Neuroscience, has discovered that, contrary to longstanding beliefs, the MTL is not related only to memory, but to perception as well. Therefore, if a stimulus is not perceived correctly by the brain, it can not be stored and retrieved correctly. What may be considered as a memory problem may actually be a problem of perception. Even the definition of amnesia as loss of memory may be inaccurate, or—at least, incomplete.Barense is clarifying how memory and perception break down in memory disorders, and is developing a new theory of amnesia. Using state-of-the-art imaging techniques, she aims to demonstrate that the MTL is related to memory and perception—and that damage to the area will cause problems with both memory and perception. Barense will also apply these techniques to brain-damaged individuals. Barense’s research will provide a new window into memory loss, and could lead to new treatments for memory disorders. "

",Tapping Endothelial Cells’ Healing Properties ," Tapping Endothelial Cells’ Healing Properties Endothelial cells line the walls of blood vessels and are vital to the healthy functioning of cardiovascular systems. As part of a process called angiogenesis, these cells drive blood vessel growth necessary to promote tissue repair after an injury. They also provide a smooth surface to prevent blood cells from sticking to the inside of blood vessels.However, endothelial cells also contribute to disease. For example, although blood vessel growth is essential for wound-healing, this process can also contribute to the growth of tumours and the spread of cancer throughout the body. Endothelial cells also play vital roles during inflammation, which is vital for wound healing. However, inflammation is also the first step in heart disease. Dr. Jason Fish, Canada Research Chair in Vascular Cell and Molecular Biology, is aiming to identify the molecular mechanisms that control the behaviour of endothelial cells. His research is improving understanding about how endothelial cells respond to their environment, and will help harness their healing properties to treat and prevent disease. For example, if scientists knew how to block the growth of blood vessels in a tumour, the tumour could be choked of a blood supply. Additionally, if angiogenesis could be stimulated at will, it would be possible to repair a heart damaged after a heart attack.Fish’s research on endothelial cells could lead to the development of innovative treatments to help people suffering from heart disease and cancer.

If inadequately treated, diabetes can lead to complications such as blindness, amputation, kidney failure, heart attack and stroke. It also can significantly increase the risk of cancer. People with diabetes are resistant to insulin, which is the key regulator of fuel metabolism. Insulin balances blood glucose and regulates protein and fat metabolism. Faced with insulin resistance, the body tries to compensate by instructing its beta cells—cells in the pancreas that make insulin—to increase production. However, the functioning of these beta cells eventually declines, and the body can no longer make enough insulin to compensate for the resistance. While there is a great deal of understanding of what happens to people with diabetes, the precise molecular mechanisms that underlie the disease are still not known. Dr. Minna Woo, Canada Research Chair in Signal Transduction in Diabetes Pathogenesis, is aiming to change this situation. Woo is looking at how tissues like liver, fat or brain tissue contribute to insulin resistance, and is discovering ways to promote increased insulin production. She is also examining the molecular processes that link abnormalities in these tissues to diabetes complications, such as cardiovascular disease or cancer. Woo’s work could help lead to new strategies to prevent and treat the growing diabetes epidemic. "

Scientists know that gene mutations and the mixing of existing variations create new gene combinations that can lead to new genetic traits. According to evolutionary theory, populations with genetic traits that are better adapted to the environment thrive and become more widespread.Dr. Loren Rieseberg, Canada Research Chair in Plant Evolutionary Genomics, is using plants of the sunflower family to unravel the puzzle of how new species arise.Wild sunflower species native to North America are remarkable for their diversity. They arose between 60,000 and 2 million years ago (a very short period in evolutionary time) and thrive in a variety of habitats, ranging from the well-watered Midwest to the harsh and difficult-to-survive in deserts, sand dunes and salt marshes of the Southwest. Rieseberg’s research has already revealed the probable genetic mechanism—hybridization between related species—that led to the adaptive radiation (the evolution of a number of divergent species from a common ancestor) of different sunflower species. He has partially reproduced these evolutionary events in greenhouse and laboratory experiments, and is now identifying the key genes that led to the evolutionary formation of new species. Rieseberg's research into the mechanics of species emergence in sunflowers is helping biologists understand events involved in the creation of other species, including animals. It will also lead to improved understanding about how plants with undesirable traits arise, and how crop plants can be improved. "

Because we are free, we are considered responsible for our actions. But what does it mean to be free? What exactly is freedom? Dr. Martin Pickavé, Canada Research Chair in Mediaeval Philosophy, believes that the best way to tackle this question is to pay attention to history — specifically, to mediaeval philosophers, who were crucial in developing the idea of a free will.Pickavé is using a comparative approach to provide a philosophical account of the mediaeval debate over freedom. While most historical research on the notion of freedom deals with single thinkers or particular groups, Pickavé is filling a gap in the literature by developing a systematic and comprehensive picture of mediaeval debates. He will also adopt a new angle, approaching the topic from the vantage point of ""agency"". We think of humans as agents contributing to their environments in various ways. Humans cause actions, which are then attributed to them. With the term ""freedom"" we seem to refer to a specific form of agency. But, it’s possible to think of other things as agents too: animals that run, crawl, eat or sleep. And what about plants? So, a further question arises: What exactly does it mean for something to be an agent?Pickavé’s research will improve understanding about the views of major philosophers and contribute to contemporary debates about free will–one of philosophy’s most important topics.

Mutations in these regulators are associated with a number of serious diseases, including cancer.Dr. Steve Bilodeau, Canada Research Chair in Transcriptional Genomics, is using a number of genomic and proteomic technologies to study how the gene expression program is regulated in embryonic stem cells and in cancer cells. His goal is to determine the molecular mechanisms involved in transcription-related diseases. Bilodeau wants to better understand how chromatin and the chromosome environment influence the gene expression program. Determining how the cellular operating system is regulated is crucial in order to understand the defective gene expression programs involved in many diseases. Since the gene expression program is the centrepiece of all cells, if it can be controlled, all cells can be controlled. Bilodeau’s research will improve understanding of how the cell’s gene expression program works in disease, and could lead to new treatments for serious diseases such as cancer. "

It operates under the notion that policy problems often cut across territorial jurisdictions and that their resolution requires institutionalized forms of collaboration between various tiers of government. Dr. Jörg Broschek, Canada Research Chair in Comparative Federalism and Multilevel Governance, is comparing the institutional architecture, evolution and performance of different systems of multilevel governance in Europe and North America.Systems of multilevel governance differ considerably in terms of their configuration, their effectiveness in addressing policy problems, and their democratic legitimacy. While multilevel governance can foster innovative solutions to a wide range of problems, it can also hinder political reforms and perpetuate democratic deficits. Broschek is developing an innovative analytical framework to compare the institutional nature and dynamics of change in different systems of multilevel governance.His research will improve understanding of multilevel governance and show how institutional designs can contribute to policy innovation and moderate democratic deficits.

People questioned whether New Orleans officials should have foreseen and prevented the destruction caused by Hurricane Katrina in 2006. Without knowledge of outcomes, people often make educated guesses about future events. However, with the benefit of outcome knowledge, people frequently make over-educated guesses about past events, claiming that they “knew it all along,” argues Dr. Daniel Bernstein, Canada Research Chair in Lifespan Cognition. This process, known as ""biased perspective-taking"", occurs in all age groups. Bernstein is combining cognitive and developmental psychology to study perspective-taking in everyone from preschoolers to senior citizens. He is also testing theories of perspective-taking in preschoolers, school-age children, and younger and older adults. His research will help dispel students’ and teachers’ frequent beliefs that students already know the instructional material they are being taught. These beliefs lead to poor learning and poor teaching. Bernstein’s research on perspective-taking will help lead to improved educational practices. "

The devices have revolutionized business and social life by allowing information to move seamlessly. However, this movement of information has a dark side; the portability that makes smartphones popular also makes them prone to theft, and their constantly connected nature makes it easier for sensitive information to be unintentionally shared. Smartphones are used sporadically, which leads to less vigilance on the part of users. Their small screen sizes often cause users to make mistakes. As well, smartphones rely more on the cloud for computation and storage than do traditional personal computers. This causes user data to spread inadvertently to other computers and networks.A key challenge is that the security software of the current smartphone is inherited from that of the decades-old personal computer. Many smartphone systems are essentially the same as that of the personal computer, but scaled down to fit in a smartphone.Dr. David Lie, Canada Research Chair in Secure and Reliable Computer Systems, will develop secure systems software that is specifically designed to address the unique security challenges of smartphones and the cloud. By doing so, Lie is taking a fundamentally different approach than most system security research, which focuses on fixing flaws in existing systems.

Clearly, disaster songs flourish in the present and are not simply a tradition of the past. Dr. Heather Sparling, Canada Research Chair in Musical Traditions, is focusing her research on disaster songs of Atlantic Canada and Gaelic songs in Nova Scotia. Sparling is assessing how music sustains communities, whether at a moment of sudden crisis, such as a mining disaster, or over a long-term challenge, such as the decline of Gaelic speakers in Nova Scotia. She is shifting the focus from consideration of how communities sustain music, such as by collecting recordings or staging a festival, to how music sustains communities.Sparling is particularly interested in song-writing as a means to building and sustaining community. Her study of whether and how language learners can be taught to write Gaelic songs will benefit local Gaelic language and cultural revival efforts. But it will also have implications for threatened languages by potentially offering alternative ways to learn minority languages. Sparling’s analysis of disaster songs will result in better understanding of their role in helping grieving local communities cope, as well as of their contribution to regional—and even national—identity.

While AIDS is the most deadly pandemic virus in the world, leishmaniasis is a parasitic infection that affects 350 million people in 88 countries, and is almost as deadly as malaria.Dr. Jérôme Estaquier, Canada Research Chair in the Pathophysiology of Cell Death in Host-Pathogen Interactions, is studying the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in the life and death of cells in response to infectious agents. Estaquier specializes in non-human primates. He is exploring molecular and cellular mechanisms in animals as they relate to the defense mechanisms of the host. Programmed cell death is a physiological process of cell suicide that plays a key role in the development and homeostasis (maintenance of a constant internal environment) of adult tissues. Abnormalities in the regulation of this process lead to aberrant cell survival, and to diseases like cancer. Conversely, premature cell death can lead to neurological or immune deficiencies. Blockage of the programmed cell death process plays an essential role in the persistence or elimination of infectious agents and whether or not diseases such as HIV infection or leishmaniasis develop. Estaquier is using immunological biochemical and genomic analyses to identify new therapeutic targets to modulate programmed cell death processes and to propose new drug or vaccine strategies for infected individuals.Estaquier’s research will help define the molecular mechanisms involved in the development of HIV and leishmaniasis, and could lead to new treatments to fight these diseases.

However, the proliferation of new media in the 21st century has radically changed how such conditions are displayed and distributed. The political potency of amateur video, activists’ use of web platforms to make international appeals for redress and artists’ engagement with the global dimensions of gender inequality (in everything from video installations to public actions) require new research tools to respond to the interdisciplinary and decentralized landscape of global media cultures. Dr. Krista Geneviève Lynes, Canada Research Chair in Feminist Media Studies, aims to improve understanding of how new media technologies and increased channels of circulation (from social network sites to museum exhibitions) affect how feminist cultural producers visualize feminist political struggle. She is investigating the global scale of media and its effect on transnational social movements, while remaining attentive to local specificity of feminist struggles. Lynes is founding a feminist media studio that will provide a forum for staging historical examples of feminist media art to forge a link between early experimental and interventionist media and present day creative and critical practices. The studio will also devise aesthetic strategies to visualize gender-based oppression and exploitation, attentive to the challenges of working across racial, gendered, class-based, and other divisions. Accordingly, Lynes is developing a feminist research network to critically engage the decentralized, collective and networked nature of cultural production.Lynes’s research will develop a feminist approach to experimental media and contemporary art in a globalized world.

These developments have brought promises of a number of applications—from bit-elements in supercomputers to miniscule carrier systems for delivering drugs inside the body—and the list of potential applications is growing exponentially.Dr. François Lagugné-Labarthet, Canada Research Chair in Nanomaterials and Photonics, is working to transform nanoscience promises into reality by developing new, high-resolution optical techniques. These techniques will make it easier for researchers to create functional nanoscale objects and investigate the properties of molecular-scaled nanomaterials.Nanostructured materials are usually identified by using classic imaging techniques, such as scanning electron microscopy. However, these tools are often limited in how much molecule-specific information they can provide. Lagugné-Labarthet is working to develop advanced optical microscopy techniques in order to better understand or manipulate these objects with unprecedented spatial resolution. The combination of atomic-force microscopy and confocal microscopy will provide detailed information about the properties of nanomaterials far beyond what researchers can currently gather. The technology would also allow researchers to link the intrinsic molecular properties of a material to its structure and size.Lagugné-Labarthet’s research could lead to the development of countless numbers of nanostructure applications for biological and materials research.

",New Treatments for Placental Disease," New Treatments for Placental Disease The placenta, which is attached to the mother and connected to the fetus by the umbilical cord, plays a number of important roles in pregnancy. It carries food and oxygen to the baby, sends waste products into the mother’s bloodstream (through which they are then disposed of), and produces hormones that help the fetus develop and the mother stay pregnant.However, up to 10 per cent of all pregnancies are affected by placental diseases. Chief among these diseases are pre-eclampsia and intra-uterine growth restriction, which affect the health of both the mother and fetus. There are no treatments for these diseases other than premature delivery. Dr. Brian Cox, Canada Research Chair in Placental Development and Maternal-Fetal Health, is exploring how the placenta is developed and organized, its genetic origins, and how it integrates maternal-fetal communication. In addition, Cox is developing stem cell-based models in order to examine the origins of placental diseases. He aims to identify changes in gene expression and cell types that occur in placental diseases. His goal is to create mathematical models that will identify the causes of these diseases.

That is the question Dr. George Pavlich, Canada Research Chair in Social Theory, Culture and Law, aims to answer. Since its inception, the Canadian justice system has promised to reduce criminal behaviour and rationalize punishment. Pavlich is seeking to reinvigorate these laudable but often unfulfilled promises by probing the theoretical foundations of crime and punishment approaches. Pavlich is conducting social, cultural and political analyses of longstanding policies in Canada that identify, define, punish and rehabilitate criminals. He is focusing on the historical role that accusations have played in identifying criminals, while also describing how persons can be framed as criminals in law and become targets for punishment. Pavlich is also reassessing Canada's enduring attachment to concepts of crime and punishment. While not denying the value of these concepts for some cases, Pavlich is examining the possibility that far fewer people need to be admitted to criminal justice institutions than is currently the case. He is also seeking socially inclusive ways to address collective harm without the use of crime and punishment systems. Pavlich’s research could alter the terms of public debate, revise the focus of criminal justice, and nurture new forms of governance in Canadian society. "

From the moment of our conception, our DNA is subject to damage. Some of this damage comes from within as a natural consequence of life, while the rest comes from environmental factors, such as radiation exposure. Dr. Aaron Goodarzi, Canada Research Chair in Genome Damage and Instability Disease, is uncovering the molecular means by which our cells resolve damage in order to keep us alive, cancer-free, and as youthful as possible.The most serious form of damage occurs when there is a break in both strands of the double helix of our DNA . Unless theses breaks are resealed correctly, whole segments of our genome can be lost, or irrevocably mutated. Failed DNA break repairs can fuel a self-propagating process of volatility within our genetic code that can lead to cancer, aging, and the toxic effects of radiation exposure. Without the pathways that repair DNA and maintain genomic stability, our species would fail. Every cell of our body incurs DNA double strand breaks on a daily basis, and there are no natural, biological mechanisms to prevent such breakdowns. Humans born unable to respond properly to DNA damage face elevated cancer risks, premature aging and radiation hypersensitivity. Goodarzi’s research will improve understanding of the processes that keep our genome stable. By doing so, it will also help explain how cancer arises, how it progresses and how it can be treated. "

Some studies indicate that about 30 per cent of people over 80 have Alzheimer’s. As life expectancy increases, a dramatic rise in the incidence of Alzheimer’s is expected. Aiming to treat the disease before patients ever show symptoms, Dr. Gerhard Multhaup, Canada Research Chair in Molecular Pharmacology, is investigating how certain Alzheimer’s drug treatments interact at the molecular level. Alzheimer’s progresses slowly, taking at least 10 to 15 years to develop from the earliest molecular changes in the brain to actual symptoms of dementia. This presymptom phase offers researchers a crucial window during which to intervene and delay?or even completely avoid?symptoms. It’s an opportunity of which Multhaup and his team want to take advantage. Studies have shown that using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) over a long period appears to delay the disease’s onset, lowering the risk of developing Alzheimer’s in the first place. A more potent generation of NSAIDs, known as gamma-secretase modulators (GSMs), selectively reduces levels of a peptide?amyloid-β (Aβ)?responsible for causing Alzheimer’s. Unfortunately, while GSMs may reduce Alzheimer’s incidence in patients not yet showing symptoms, they can also exaggerate it in people with mild symptoms or other signs of advanced brain changes. Multhaup’s team will investigate the apparently mixed effects of NSAIDs/GSMs. With the knowledge they gain, new drug interventions for Alzheimer’s patients will be developed. Multhaup’s research results could change the future for many, ultimately leading to better interventions for this currently devastating disorder. "

The Sleiman group has constructed DNA nanotubes (nanometre-scale tube-like structures) that hold cargo which is rapidly released when specific biological molecules are added. These tiny DNA cargo carriers can penetrate mammalian cells and Sleiman is now optimizing them for medical applications. These include delivery vehicles that can selectively release drug treatments into diseased cells and cellular probes that can sense, predict and possibly even prevent disease.

While the settlers of the Maritime provinces and Ontario were primarily English-speaking, the Canadian Prairies were divided into settlements of French, Métis, German, Ukrainian, Mennonite, Hutterite and other groups. Assimilation eventually led these groups to speak English, but not before they made their mark on the English spoken in the region. The French spoken in the Prairies is also unique. Like English, settlement and immigration play an important role, but contact with First Nations languages can also be important, for example in francophone-Métis speech. An entirely new language, known as Michif, was created in Red River Valley due to language contact between cultures. Michif, a blend of French, Plains Cree, Ojibwa and English, is now an endangered Métis language exclusive to the Canadian Prairies.Dr. Nicole Rosen, Canada Research Chair in Language Interactions, is taking advantage of Manitoba’s diverse population to break new ground in the study of linguistic interactions that have taken place and are currently taking place between English, French and First Nations language speakers.Rosen’s research will enhance understanding of the subtle language interactions that take place in communities that are in proximity to each other. The research could also have an impact on the linguistic and educational policies and tools that will be developed for groups such as recent immigrant and First Nations children. "

Atmospheric warming is causing large-scale degradation of permafrost and this has significant economic, social and environmental implications. Reliable knowledge of current and future conditions of permafrost is needed so that strategies and policies can be developed to deal with associated risks, costs and mitigation measures. Dr. Stephan Gruber, Canada Research Chair in Climate Change Impacts/Adaptation in Northern Canada, is investigating permafrost using new sensor technology to determine the effects of subsurface energy gains on characteristics such as ice and water content. Gruber is also using computer modeling across larger regions to take into account changes in topography, vegetation and subsurface material. By integrating fine-scale ground observations with large-scale simulations, he aims to refine computer models to better predict and assess global trends. Thawing permafrost affects wildlife habitats, erosion and natural hazards as well as the integrity of buildings and roads. Gruber’s research will improve understanding of permafrost environments and provide a better picture of risks to ecosystems and infrastructure. It will lead to the development of more accurate and traceable measurements and computer simulations of permafrost change and thus allow to more effectively manage the economic and social costs of climate change.

The water is often untreated or only partially treated and poses risks to health and the environment.This issue is a particular challenge for small rural communities in the Far North. Conventional wastewater treatment plants in larger cities require a lot of energy, chemicals and technical staff to operate. Implementing such systems in remote northern regions would place an unsustainable financial and human resources burden on these small communities. Dr. Rob Jamieson, Canada Research Chair in Cold Regions Ecological Engineering, is investigating how ecologically engineered systems can be used for water management in cold climates. Jamieson aims to integrate naturally-occurring biochemical processes in the design of sustainable environmental management systems and assess their potential environmental risks. For example, constructed wetlands for wastewater treatment do not require energy and chemical inputs. They are also relatively cheap and easy to maintain, making them an attractive option for small, remote communities with limited resources. Jamieson’s research will lead to the development of design guidelines for wastewater treatment systems in the Far North that will reduce environmental and health risks. "

",Quantum Weirdness for Future Technologies," Quantum Weirdness for Future Technologies Quantum mechanics, one of the pillars of modern physics, can predict the behaviour of light and matter to an astonishing degree. But the quantum world is also very weird and different from the world we usually experience. Things happen randomly with no apparent cause: a particle can be in two places at once and distant particles can exhibit what Albert Einstein referred to as “spooky action at a distance.” Recent developments have provided a glimpse of the technological promise of quantum weirdness. For example, computers that operate on quantum-bits, rather than the language of 0s and 1s in today’s laptops, would solve tasks that stump current computers. Dr. Kevin Resch, Canada Research Chair in Optical Quantum Technologies, is working to develop quantum mechanical sources of light for new quantum technologies. Resch aims to implement a new protocol for secure remote access to remote quantum computers—the “quantum cloud.” He plans to transform quantum-based technology into an optical imaging platform capable of measuring biological tissue structure for medical applications, such as non-invasive medical imaging for early-stage disease detection.Resch’s research will help shape the coming second quantum revolution and result in quantum technologies for applications from computing to imaging.

Our current understanding of the universe is that its fundamental building blocks are comprised of leptons (like the electron), quarks and gluons (that make protons and neutrons) and that each force is associated to a fundamental particle. These particles and their interactions form the basis of what is known as the Standard Model of particle physics. But while this model describes almost everything around us, it does not explain what dark matter is and why we are made of matter and not anti-matter. Dr. Alison Lister, Canada Research Chair in Particle Physics, is working on one of the largest scientific collaborations on the planet—the ATLAS particle physics experiment at the Large Hadron Collider, the world’s largest and most powerful particle accelerator. At the Large Hadron Collider in Switzerland, circulating beams of protons are collided, creating the highest-energy, man-made collisions ever seen. Lister believes that the heaviest of the quarks, the top quark, holds the key to finding signs of phenomena that cannot be explained by the Standard Model of particle physics and is scrutinizing data for signs of these new particles.The answers Lister obtains from her research may completely change the way we view our universe.

However, other artificial universes can be built where such exotic particles can exist. These particles move around in the background in what is known as “strange vacuum” states, which differ from familiar empty spaces. Remarkably, these strange vacuum states may be created in real materials when cooled to temperatures near absolute zero—about -273 C. Here, the existence of exotic particles is a consequence of the rules of quantum mechanics when applied to matter on a large scale.Dr. Roger Melko, Canada Research Chair in Computational Quantum Many-Body Physics, is making sense of this strange quantum world. With the help of massive supercomputers on which he has built sophisticated models of real materials, Melko is tackling the task of solving quantum equations of motion.

This is because our biological (or circadian) clocks coordinate our physiology and behaviour with the day-night cycle. All organisms—not just people—have circadian clocks, which allow them to tell time and to coordinate life processes according to the 24-hour clock.While we know intuitively that disrupting our circadian clocks can cause problems, Dr. Hai-ying Cheng, Canada Research Chair in Molecular Genetics of Biological Clocks, aims to discover exactly what’s going on at the cellular and molecular level when this happens. Cheng is using mouse genetics, microscopic imaging and animal behaviour to provide insights into how environmental factors regulate circadian clocks. Her goal is to identify the genes that regulate the functioning of our circadian clocks.Circadian clock dysfunction is tightly linked to aging and to a host of diseases including Alzheimer’s, bipolar disorder, heart disease, cancer, obesity and diabetes. Cheng’s research will improve understanding of what happens when clocks are disrupted clocks and help us control the medical consequences. "

A one-size-fits-all view of the core steps involved in metabolism has been outlined over the past century using experimental data from everything from bacteria to yeast and cows’ hearts. However, the resulting piecemeal view has confused organism-specific steps, and has many missing steps. Dr. Amy Caudy, Canada Research Chair in Metabolomics for Functional Enzyme Discovery, aims to advance understanding of metabolism by focusing on two major gaps in our knowledge. Firstly, while we know that many chemical reactions occur as cells break down nutrients, we do not know which enzymes—genes that act as catalysts—make these reactions happen. Secondly, recent technological advances have led to the discovery of hundreds of chemicals in cells. These chemicals are not predicted by, and are absent from, current models of metabolism. What they do is unknown. Caudy aims to discover the function of these mysterious chemicals, and to use yeast to find the “missing enzymes.” Because the majority of metabolic reactions are shared across all life, organisms like yeast can be used to lay the groundwork for improving understanding about the metabolism of human and other mammalian cells. Caudy’s research will help lead to the discovery of new metabolic pathways—or series of chemical reactions in cells—that will provide new targets for drugs that block the growth of cancer cells. "

A human cell performs the same task with the information stored in DNA, transporting this information as messenger RNA (mRNA)from one part of the cell to another.mRNA is made in a compartment of the cell called the nucleus, but the information in mRNA is used in a different compartment. This requires the mRNA to exit the nucleus by a process of RNA transport. RNA transport is made possible by complex cellular machines, called ""nuclear pore complexes"", that act as gateways between the nucleus and the rest of the cell.While researchers know that mutations affecting these gateways and the RNA transport process are associated with multiple diseases, it remains mostly unknown how these mutations lead to disease.

",Understanding the Fungal Foe," Understanding the Fungal Foe Candida albicans, a human pathogenic fungus, is the cause of vaginal yeast infections and thrush, both unpleasant infections of human skin surfaces. It can also cause blood-stream infections in people whose immune systems are defective, such as patients undergoing chemotherapy or receiving organ transplants. Tragically, such blood-stream infections are frequently fatal. Because the cells of fungi like C. albicans function very similarly to human cells, the antibiotics that have been so successful in treating bacterial infections are not active against them. And, the current antifungal drugs can have serious side effects. Researchers, therefore there need to identify new targets for the development of new antifungal therapies.In order to identify any chinks in the fungal armour that could be exploited for developing new drugs to fight C. albicans, it is important to first understand the fungus' cellular characteristics that make it a successful colonizer of the human body. Dr. Malcolm Whiteway and his research team are using the tools of genomics—such as large collections of variant C. albicans strains, and high-throughput analysis of gene expression and regulation—to examine the cellular properties of the fungus. Whiteway is investigating C. albicans behaviours, such as its impressive ability to change shape, to use a variety of sugars as food and maintain itself in the presence of the human immune system, that distinguish these pathogenic fungal cells from those of the fungus' relatives, such as free-living baker’s yeast. Applying the tools and concepts of genomics, proteomics and molecular biology to the characterization of cellular function, regulation and evolution in pathogenic and free-living fungi, Whiteway’s highly multidisciplinary research is at the crossroads of several fields of study, including microbiology, molecular biology, evolution, genomics and bioinformatics. Ultimately, having a deeper understanding of how C. albicans functions will allow us to exploit unique characteristics that can lead to a new generation of antifungal drugs with limited side effects.

For many, the effect of the pain is short-lived. However, one in 10 Canadians experience disability because of musculoskeletal pain every year. Whether related to work, traffic collisions or normal activities of daily life, the personal and economic impacts of musculoskeletal disability are extremely burdensome and costly to individuals and society. Why some people become disabled and others do not is a question that has puzzled health care providers, policymakers and researchers for years. Dr. Pierre Côté, Canada Research Chair in Disability Prevention and Rehabilitation, is aiming to answer that question and to develop strategies that limit the consequences of musculoskeletal disability. Doing so is difficult because musculoskeletal disability is a health condition that is broader than diseases or medical diagnoses. Its development is influenced by individual and societal perceptions, beliefs and attitudes. Therefore, untying the disability knot requires a comprehensive research perspective that extends from the lab to the community. Côté is studying the causes of musculoskeletal disability to develop effective interventions that will prevent or limit the detrimental consequences of musculoskeletal pain. He is also championing collaborations across health disciplines to develop relevant solutions for the public, patients, health care providers and decision-makers.

Although this is partly due to environmental factors, such as malnutrition or unhygienic living conditions, genetics also play a substantial role. Yet very little is known about the underlying genetic factors that make some people more likely than others to succumb to infectious diseases. As Canada Research Chair in Functional and Evolutionary Genomics of the Immune System, Dr. Luis Barreiro aims to identify individual genes, as well as entire genetic pathways, whose response to viruses or bacteria varies among individuals and populations, and can be mapped to a specific physical location of a gene or other DNA sequence on a chromosome. Combining cutting-edge genomic techniques with immunological and evolutionary genetic tools, Barreiro and his research team are also studying why humans and primates—our close evolutionary relatives—respond differently to many infections. For example, while AIDS, malaria, and cancer kill millions of humans every year, several non-human primates appear to have natural protection against them. This is thought to stem in part from how different species’ immune systems respond to infections. Barreiro’s research may help explain differences in various primates’ susceptibility to diseases. Barreiro’s research offers insight into the genetic reasons for different immune responses to infection. Understanding this variation is a key step toward more accurate diagnoses and new, improved strategies to prevent infectious diseases and other immune-related disorders. "

Dr. Annette Desmarais, Canada Research Chair in Human Rights, Social Justice and Food Sovereignty, is focusing her research on food sovereignty—an approach that is gaining momentum internationally. Food sovereignty is grounded in people’s right to democratically define and control their own food systems in ways that allow them to make decisions about what food is grown, where and how it is grown, who produces it, and on what scale. Desmarais is exploring food sovereignty in a number of countries. Her research involves linking human rights and social justice with issues of access to and control over food-producing resources such as land, water and seeds. Desmarais is also investigating how food sovereignty may contribute to socially just, environmentally sustainable production of safe, healthy food, as well as to fair food markets and to viable livelihoods for farmers. Desmarais’ research will contribute to current debates about international development approaches and public policies geared towards helping eradicate rural poverty, building vibrant rural communities, and enhancing local, national and global food security.

But, of course, this is far from the case. Dionne is trying to find the most effective dose of exercise—possibly, combined with nutritional changes—to prevent Type 2 diabetes and physical disability among the elderly. She is studying how the human body adapts to different forms of exercise, in order to find the right exercise prescription. Just like it would be foolish to think a single drug could cure all diseases, it is also unlikely that a single exercise prescription would be able to develop all muscle groups or would be appropriate for all types of metabolism. Dionne’s research will help address one of the biggest challenges governing health—the prevention of disease among the elderly. "

Recent studies suggest that a partial vitamin K deficiency could be linked to obesity, insulin resistance and diabetes. A better understanding of the role that vitamin K plays in these pathologies could lead to new treatments and diagnostic tools. Dr. Mathieu Ferron, Canada Research Chair in Bone and Energy Metabolism, is interested in discovering and characterizing the role played by vitamin K in energy metabolism. His uses genetically modified mice whose coding genes for vitamin K have been disabled in certain organs—for example, the pancreas cells, which produce insulin. Research by Ferron and his team is underlining the important role that bone tissue plays in energy metabolism. In fact, bones produce a hormone, called osteocalcin, that stimulates the pancreas to secrete insulin and increases other tissues’ sensitivity to it. Since the function of osteocalcin is in part regulated by vitamin K, this research may also help us make sense of how osteocalcin interacts with glucose metabolism. These studies will help us to better understand the physiological roles played by bone tissue and the pancreas, and could ultimately lead to more effective treatments for diabetes and obesity. "

",This research could lead to progress in the fight against a protein that is implicated in leukemia and other forms of cancer.,Switching Off a Cancer Protein," Switching Off a Cancer Protein Cancer is the leading cause of death in Canada, and the disease continues to put significant demands on health-care systems. However, Dr. Patrick Gunning, Canada Research Chair in Medicinal Chemistry, is hoping to make progress against Stat5, a protein that plays a key role in many cancers. When Stat5 is working normally, it is switched on for a few minutes, helps cells grow, and then switches off. However, in leukemia, it doesn’t switch off, and goes on to promote tumour growth. Stat5 also promotes resistance to anti-cancer drugs deployed to treat the disease. So far, no drug has been developed to directly target Stat5—it was always believed to be an impossible task. Gunning, however, has developed a new molecule that is showing promise in the lab and in animal models. It works by binding to Stat5 and switching it off. Significantly, healthy cells do not suffer side effects, meaning the molecule has the potential to become a gentler, more targeted chemotherapy drug. Next up is testing the molecule in living systems, which means the molecule must be able to penetrate cell membranes, be the right size to pass through the small intestine, and not be metabolized by the body. Gunning’s research could lead to clinical trials for his molecule, and new hope in the battle against cancer. "

We need innovative methods to interact efficiently with vast amounts of data, using a variety of digital devices—from mobile devices to large, digital whiteboards in collaborative settings. Such tools will soon be accessible. Dr. Pourang Irani, Canada Research Chair in Ubiquitous Analytics, has a vision for the next generation of analytic tools—one in which ubiquitous computing will facilitate insight-driven interaction with data anywhere. For individuals, this would mean being able to make sound decisions:,for example, before purchasing goods, or in locating the closest shelter during an emergency. Organizations, meanwhile, would have tools that allow a higher degree of information-sharing and interaction among multiple participants in co-located or remote settings. These tools may, for example, be useful in identifying the source of a disease. Irani’s research will advance information visualization, navigation and manipulation interfaces on ubiquitous computing platforms, to help users derive insight from data. He aims to transform the next generation of mobile and ubiquitous technologies into decision-facilitating portals.

It’s a big moment when a child around the age of one speaks his or her first word—mama, flower, truck, more—in a way that is clearly understood by others. But getting to this point begins much earlier in the child’s life. Language acquisition experts now know that the process of learning to speak begins when children are babies. Between the age of six and 10 months, infants acquire the phoneme (sounds that distinguish one word from another) inventory of their language, learn to segment words from speech, and begin to attach meanings to words. This early development in language acquisition is depends critically on factors in the child’s environment. Dr. Elizabeth Johnson, Canada Research Chair in Spoken Language Acquisition, aims to show how early life experience shapes the ability of children to perceive, produce and comprehend spoken language. She believes it is difficult to define normal speech development without taking into account the wide variety of environments experienced by children. Johnson is exploring whether infants whose primary caregivers are late learners of English face different developmental challenges than those whose parents learned English early. She is also examining what factors should be considered when assessing language skills and vocabulary size in infants who receive exposure to multiple varieties of spoken English. Johnson’s research will improve knowledge about how children learn their mother tongue, and may also help identify language delays in children raised in linguistically diverse settings. "

For most, the cold is nothing more than an annoyance that goes away in a few days. However, other, more destructive viral illnesses represent a major threat. Yellow fever, measles, influenza and smallpox have been causing epidemics for thousands of years; 1918’s Spanish flu killed tens of millions of people, while collectively, measles and smallpox are responsible for the deaths of hundreds of millions. HIV, the virus that leads to AIDS, remains a global pandemic. Other dangerous viruses, like SARS, H1N1, West Nile and Ebola, emerge or re-emerge annually. The immune system’s ability to recognize and restrict viral pathogens is crucial in fighting infectious diseases. Dr. Jeffrey Lee, Canada Research Chair in Structural Virology, is using cutting-edge techniques to discover new targets and structural models developing antiviral treatments. Dr. Lee and his team are pursuing an innovative, interdisciplinary approach to better understand the molecular mechanisms involved in how viruses enter cells and are then attacked by immune system molecules.

Dr. Long Li, Canada Research Chair in Stable Isotope Geochemistry, is using stable isotopes (forms of an element distinguished by having different numbers of neutrons) to investigate such weighty questions. Stable isotopes provide an excellent way to reconstruct ancient geological and biological events. In particular, Li and his group are focusing on applying nitrogen isotope systems to probe interactions between Earth’s surface and interior, and investigating the these interactions’ impacts on the climate and environment. Nitrogen is particularly interesting, since it is the key element linking the atmosphere, biosphere (the zone of life on Earth) and the solid Earth. Li and his team will develop state-of-the-art techniques to examine and analyze trace amounts of nitrogen from ancient organisms that have been transferred into hard rocks. By comparing the isotopic signatures of ancient and modern organic compounds, Li will shed light on ecological responses to past catastrophic events such as supervolcanic eruptions, meteorite impacts, and other abrupt climate and environmental changes.

Newman is helping provide a balance among different rights and interests in areas such as natural resource development that involves indigenous communities. For example, Newman aims to understand how courts, communities, policy-makers, and other stakeholders can work together to create a policy framework that enables responsible resource development while respecting indigenous rights. To do this, he is studying indigenous rights norms both in Canada and within international law. He is examining how local circumstances make it more or less appropriate to draw on international legal experience in developing legal frameworks. By looking at both constitutional and international law, Newman is also examining how these legal systems can adapt in order to offer a more effective voice to indigenous communities. In addition, his research is shedding light on how indigenous advocacy can best make use of the interaction between these different legal orders.

Hydrates contain a vast but as yet untapped, amount of clean, unconventional natural gas, and could play a major role in Canada’s future energy supply. However, before this potential can be realized, a number of key questions have to be answered about how natural gas from hydrates can be recovered in an environmentally safe and sustainable fashion. Dr. Jeffrey Priest, Canada Research Chair in Geomechanics of Gas Hydrates, is setting out to answer these questions. Priest aims to improve understanding of the relationship between gas hydrates and the sediment itself, especially during a process called ""dissociation"", in which hydrates are transformed back to their individual components of water and gas. Gas is extracted from the sediment during this dissociation. Laboratory testing can help identify effective methods for gas recovery. However, as dissociation can also dramatically change the behaviour of the sediment, testing will also help researchers understand sediment changes.Priest’s research will lead to the development of methods to recover natural gas from hydrates in an economical, safe and environmentally friendly way. It will also help Canada manage its natural resources while meeting its obligations to help reduce future climate change. "

More specifically, they are developing methods to identify the genetic mutations that lead to traits of interest (such as antibiotic resistance or virulence) and allow bacteria to use and compete for resources in specific ecosystems. This research will shed new light on the microbial world and the evolutionary processes that affect our environment and our health. Ultimately, the goal is to develop the ability to sample any habitat—be it a lake or an infected patient—and then to sequence microbial DNA from that habitat and predict potential risks and possible interventions.

In India alone, it is estimated there is a shortage of more than three million girls under age 6, largely due to discrimination in the form of sex-selective abortion, excessive female mortality, and neglect. While this daughter deficit is slowing down in some parts of India, it is persistent or emerging in other parts of India and in other countries. The daughter deficit has resulted in a shortage of brides, a surplus of males, bride migration, and increased prospects of violence against women. Dr. Sharada Srinivasan, Canada Research Chair in Gender, Justice and Development, is examining the gender transformation that is underway as a result of the daughter deficit, in order to create a favourable environment for daughters, and for the emergence of a “daughter preference.” She is using a feminist perspective to explore the changes that are occurring due to daughter deficits, and is combining theoretical insights from different disciplines. Srinivasan is also gathering evidence to demystify practices that allow “son preference” and “daughter aversion” to continue, including by examining the relative contributions that daughters and sons make to their families. Srinivasan’s research will help weaken the perception in some societies that daughters are burdensome.

Stolow’s research expands our structural view of nature by developing a “molecular choreography”. He also uses coherent laser pulses to create new “molecular ballets,” directing chemical reactions to undergo novel pathways. Stolow and his team are developing new laser sources that produce ultrashort pulses ranging from infrared to X-rays. These ultrashort pulses let the researchers observe and control some of the fastest processes in nature—electronic and atomic motions. Combining these lasers with advanced molecular beam and particle detection techniques, the team creates ultrafast “movies” revealing how bonds rearrange and atoms move during molecular processes, including chemical reactions. Use special optical techniques to shape laser pulses, Stolow and his team have also developed new forms of optical microscopy, allowing real-time label-free videos of live cells. Stolow’s ultrafast laser research will increase our understanding of the dynamic processes which underpin all chemical and biological processes. This will lead to significant advances in molecular devices and biomedical imaging, as well as photoactivated drugs, catalysts and other responsive materials. "

The consequences of these diseases are so significant that diagnosis of the first BSE case in Canada led to an immediate closure of trade borders for beef and beef products, and a huge economic loss for the country.Both diseases are prion diseases, a family of rare, progressive and transmissible brain disorders that affect both humans and animals. No therapy is available for these fatal diseases, which can occur in sporadic, genetic or infectious forms. The most contagious prion disease is “chronic wasting disease” affecting deer, elk and moose. Chronic wasting disease can affect both farmed and wild animals.,S spread of the disease is currently uncontrollable. The infectious agent, the prion , is unique because it consists solely of a misfolded form of a protein produced naturally in the body. Unlike bacteria or viruses, prions don’t require genetic information to propagate. Dr. Sabine Gilch , Canada Research Chair in Prion Disease Research, aims to decipher how neurons respond to prion infection, and how prions are released and transported by these cells, by using cell-culture models of prion infection. Gilch is also evaluating the effects that new compounds have on the spread of prions and the progression of disease in animal models. Gilch’s research will improve understanding of the molecular biology of prion diseases, and eventually lead to better treatments for these serious diseases. "

About one-eighth of senior women identify urinary incontinence as a chronic health condition that has an impact on their daily lives, making it almost as prevalent as diabetes and heart disease. The number of senior women in Canada is expected to grow from 2.7 million in 2010 to more than 7 million by 2061, with a corresponding growth in the need for urinary incontinence treatment. While the prevalence of urinary incontinence increases as women age, it is not actually a symptom of aging. However, most women go untreated, and suffer the devastating medical, financial, and lifestyle-altering consequences in silence. The physiopathology (physiology and pathology) of urinary incontinence and its link to aging are poorly understood. Right now, it is impossible to identify which women may be most likely to benefit from treatment. Dr. Chantal Dumoulin, Canada Research Chair in Urogynecological Health and Aging, aims to improve our understanding of urinary incontinence and develop better and more cost-effective physiotherapy treatments, and to create a diagnostic tool that will help clinicians determine whether physiotherapy is the most appropriate treatment option for a given patient and identify which physiotherapy approaches would be most effective for specific incontinence types and patient characteristics.

Universal access, however, combined with high demand for limited resources, have led to a gap in service availability that often results in long wait times for patients. Dr. Hossein Abouee Mehrizi, Canada Research Chair in Healthcare Operations Management, is pursuing ways to help hospitals better meet their target wait times and reduce how often patients are readmitted; he knows that long delays waiting for services can cause anxiety, pain and reduced quality of life—potentially even putting patients’ lives at risk. This is one reason why Canada adopted a point-based emergency room triage system, one prioritizing patients based on the urgency of their need. To ensure that patients with lower priorities are not kept waiting for an unreasonable amount of time, the system also covers specific wait time targets for each point score. In practice, meeting these target wait times has proven challenging. While there have been many promising recommendations and initiatives in recent years—including efforts to admit more high-risk patients by freeing up in-patient beds more quickly—research has found that shorter lengths of hospital stay reliably lower patient readmission rates. Dr. Abouee Mehrizi is addressing these issues by designing a dynamic new patient-prioritization system, aimed at allowing hospitals to quickly adapt to changing circumstances. Future projects include the development and testing of new guidelines for hospital discharges. Abouee Mehrizi’s research will help hospitals meet target wait times, reduce patient readmissions and provide better healthcare for Canadians. "

That mitochondria do more than make energy is a relatively new observation, one that has given rise to the young field of mitochondrial dynamics. Dr. Stephen Archer, Canada Research Chair in Mitochondrial Dynamics and Translational Medicine, is fascinated by mitochondria, and believes they hold the key to treating several lethal lung diseases, including pulmonary arterial hypertension (increased pressure in the pulmonary arteries) and non-small-cell lung cancer. Mitochondria are best known for generating the energy-containing molecule ATP. Other mitochondrial functions include playing roles in regulating programmed cell death (apoptosis) and cell proliferation. The historical view of mitochondria as isolated structures has also been replaced by the recognition that they exist in dynamic networks that continuously join (fusion) and divide (fission). In fact, whenever a cell divides, its mitochondria must also divide, so that these organelles are equally shared by the daughter cells. The ability of mitochondria to change from networked to fragmented states is known as ""mitochondrial dynamics"" and is controlled by a small number of enzymes. Archer is using superresolution confocal microscopy to observe the secret lives of mitochondria, and develop new understanding of how these once free-living bacteria (before humans became their hosts) regulate cell division, death and quality control. Archer has discovered that structural mitochondrial abnormalities contribute to both rapid cell growth and apoptosis-resistance in pulmonary arterial hypertension and non-small-cell lung cancer. By forcing fusion, he has tricked cells to stop dividing and die. The result has been therapies that reduce the severity of pulmonary arterial hypertension and shrink lung cancer tumours. Archer’s research suggests that mitochondrial dynamics may be the Achilles heel of pulmonary arterial hypertension and non-small-cell lung cancer. His research is aiming a therapeutic arrow at this vulnerable target. "

Many developing countries have adopted democratic governments in recent decades. However, there is an increasing perception that the shift has not always translated into better government. It has been suggested that voter patronage systems—in which politicians trade favours or gifts to individuals in exchange for their votes—may be an important barrier to creating governments that are responsive to voters’ needs. The idea is that voters highly value what they are getting in exchange for their vote (e.g., money, medicines, water); as a result, politicians in power benefit from households that lack access to resources or public goods and services. Dr. Gustavo Bobonis, Canada Research Chair in the Political Economy of Development, is investigating the challenges involved in establishing good governments in emerging democracies. Bobonis is leading comprehensive studies in northeast Brazil and southern Mexico, to investigate the relationships between poverty, patronage and government responsiveness. In Brazil, he is examining whether providing private water access to families in remote rural areas that lack water will change the way they vote, their relationships with politicians, and government’s responsiveness to their needs. In Mexico, Bobonis is exploring whether gradual political reforms that pass decision-making power on to local indigenous groups improve families’ access to public goods and services.

To protect genetic information, all living things have evolved to find systems to repair DNA damage. In humans, these repair systems also provide a primary defence against DNA mutations that cause cancer. Dr. Mark Glover, Canada Research Chair in Structural Molecular Biology, is examining how these systems function to protect our DNA. The critical role these systems play in protecting against cancer is underscored by the fact that inherited mutations in the genes that detect and repair DNA damage are linked to major hereditary human cancer syndromes. Perhaps the best known of these genes is the breast and ovarian cancer-associated protein, BRCA1. Glover is using protein-imaging techniques to provide 3D detail of how DNA protective proteins such as BRCA1 assemble around regions of DNA damage. To date, his research has revealed how BRCA1 functions as a DNA defender, and has also shed light on how BRCA1 mutations can block DNA’s normal function, leading to cancer development.

However, as oceans actually contain much more carbon than does the atmosphere, they ultimately determine atmospheric carbon concentrations. While the planet’s oceans naturally absorb about a third of the carbon dioxide humans produce, this will change as the oceans grow warmer and more acidic. Dr. Roberta Hamme, Canada Research Chair in Ocean Carbon Dynamics, studies the complexities of the ocean carbon cycle in order to predict future changes. Dr. Hamme’s research analyzes the biological transformation of carbon, the chemical balance of its different forms and the physics of how oceans move. The effects of biological, chemical and physical processes on carbon compete against each other and are hard to separate. Dr. Hamme teases these effects apart by making highly precise measurements of dissolved gases like oxygen, and inert gases like argon, krypton and xenon. Dr. Hamme uses these measurements to differentiate biology from physics and to understand how carbon responds to the same processes. Oxygen, for example, can be used to quantify biological productivity in the oceans, while inert gases offer insights into physical processes, as their patterns have no biological response and are caused by physics alone. This research will uncover the secrets of how carbon moves through the oceans—and how this may change—leading to better future predictions of climate change. "

But current agricultural practices can cause a host of environmental challenges, ranging from overuse of fertilizers, to extensive soil erosion and rapid deforestation. However, innovative approaches to agricultural management can minimize these negative effects and result in environmental and societal benefits. Dr. Marney Isaac, Canada Research Chair in Agroecosystems and Development, aims to make agriculture more productive, while reducing environmental impacts. She intends to do so by maximizing ecosystem services—benefits, like carbon storage, water-use efficiency, and biodiversity, that can be realized by modifying some agricultural environments. For example, trees in agricultural fields can cycle soil nutrients, sequester carbon and prevent erosion, as well as contribute to people’s livelihoods. Isaac and her team are measuring tree-crop interactions in order to achieve economic and environmental goals. With extensive experience in diverse agroecosystems, both in Canada and abroad, Isaac is using a multidisciplinary approach that draws from ecology, soil science, sociology and development studies. Her research is uniquely positioned for understanding the intersection of people and the plants they grow. Isaac’s research will not only lead to the design of more efficient, resilient, and greener agriculture, but will contribute to our understanding of the links between the biophysical and human aspects of agriculture.

Power plants, cement factories and breweries rarely recycle the carbon dioxide they emit as waste gases. Dr. Philip Jessop, Canada Research Chair in Green Chemistry, wants to make the chemical and energy industries greener by identifying ways of recycling waste carbon dioxide. Dr. Jessop believes reusing carbon dioxide can help the environment and make industrial processes more efficient and economical, using less energy and fewer raw materials. The most environmentally damaging and financially costly steps in chemical processes are usually those in which desired products are separated from solvents, reagents and other materials. Dr. Jessop focusses on the design of “switchable” or “smart” materials, including solvents and detergents, to make these separation steps much easier. Using recycled carbon dioxide as the trigger, these switchable materials will be able to shift between two forms possessing very different properties—such as a solvent that can switch between a form that dissolves things and one that does not, or a detergent that switches between a form that picks up oil and one able to release it again. Dr. Jessop’s research will lead to the development of flexible switchable materials. The result will simplify separation processes, using less energy, consuming fewer raw materials and recycling more materials, including waste carbon dioxide. "

Instead, many animal species exhibit widespread differences in reproductive or behavioural traits among individuals; these alternative reproductive traits are believed to play a fundamental role in creating biodiversity. Our knowledge of exactly how these traits are expressed, however, is still limited. Dr. Clint Kelly, Canada Research Chair in Behavioural Ecology, is tackling this puzzle by studying various insect species. One is the Wellington tree weta. Males of this large, flightless, cricket-like New Zealand insect exhibit major differences between individuals—some males, for example, have large jaws that they use to fend off rivals over access to females, while others without this trait are have adapted to sneak surreptitiously into groups of females. How such differences develop and are passed along remains a mystery of this and many other species. Kelly’s research will offer insights into the evolution of such alternative traits, identifying how genetics, hormones and nutrition affect individual growth and development. In addition, Kelly’s research will measure and identify individual behaviour and establish how different species—and populations within species— vary in appearance and behaviour. This research will provide deeper understanding of different traits in biology, and will shed light on their roles in the evolution of species. "

Dr. Kathrin Koslicki, Canada Research Chair in Epistemology and Metaphysics, defines the question as “the study of being in its most general form”, or metaphysics. Koslicki takes inspiration from Aristotle, who was the source of the word ""metaphysics"". However, Koslicki is contributing to a significant reorientation of analytic metaphysics that incorporates formal logic, aims for compatibility with science, and strives for argumentative clarity and precision. Koslicki is developing a new approach to metaphysics that focuses on the question of how the parts of objects are related to the whole they compose. For example, her theory of parts and wholes posits that an H2O molecule requires that the two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom that compose to be arranged in the particular manner of chemical bonding, which requires the atoms to share electrons. Koslicki’s research is tailor-made for collaborative projects and co-authored publications involving researchers from across Canada and around the world. Koslicki envisions exchanges of ideas through workshops, outside speakers, reading groups, and cross-disciplinary presentations. Koslicki’s research on an ancient discipline will position Canada to take a lead role in modern metaphysics. "

But to accurately understand the role of social media in movements like the Arab Spring, Dr. Merlyna Lim believes we must also consider the spatial, historical and socio-political contexts where such protests take place. As Canada Research Chair in Digital Media and Global Network Society, Lim is looking at how digital media interacts with traditional networking, urban spaces, and activism to understand the role of these elements in social movements. Her focus is on how they grow out of a society and culture where familiarity with digital media is part of daily life. Using observations based on numerous protests and mass movements around the world, Lim and her research team will generate conceptual and theoretical frameworks that describe the relationships between digital media and urban spaces, and how this interplay contributes to contemporary social movements such as the Occupy Hong Kong protests, the post-Tahrir youth movements in Egypt, and the Berish electoral reform rallies in Malaysia. Lim’s multidisciplinary research will offer a better understanding of the relationships between these forces and help to initiate and sustain an ongoing dialogue between different disciplines, such as communications and urban research.

But the sheer size and complexity of these datasets poses challenges for scientists. As Canada Research Chair in Biostatistics for Spatial and High-Dimensional Data, Dr. Farouk Nathoo wants to develop new approaches that will help scientists process and understand this data. Neuroimaging studies can involve large datasets that describe the brain’s anatomy, function and connectivity.

The global commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and the growing demand for clean energy, have spurred innovation. Our renewable energy sources are still not being exploited to their full potential. One of the barriers is the intermittency of many renewable sources. For example, when the wind drops, wind turbines stop turning, meaning that consumers cannot rely on a steady flow of energy. Dr. Martin Ordonez, Canada Research Chair in Power Converters for Renewable Energy Systems, is helping maximize the use of renewable energy resources by developing methods and power architectures to store and deploy renewable energy. The results would provide communities and industry with reliable, low greenhouse gas emission power. Ordonez is developing power converters and controllers needed for large-scale smart energy systems that can extract, transform, store and generate low-emission power from a variety of intermittent sources. His innovative technologies and techniques will enable engineers to create highly flexible, robust energy systems for buildings, industrial applications and, ultimately, entire communities. These energy systems will be able not only to adjust to daily fluctuations in energy demands, but also to increase their capacity as reliance on renewable energy grows.

However, gravity can sometimes cause rocks and soil to fail, causing landslides that pose significant risk to peoples’ lives, livelihoods and infrastructure. Gravity doesn’t act alone to cause landslides. Rather, there is a very strong relationship between weather events and slope instability. Since climate change is expected to increase both the amount of precipitation and the frequency and severity of extreme rainfalls in Canada, it has the potential to have significant consequences on the magnitude and frequency of landslides. Dr. Andy Take, Canada Research Chair in Geotechnical Engineering, aims to better understand the complex links between climate and slope instability. His discoveries will help him answer a number of questions about the nature of these effects, including: Will a higher total amount of precipitation and increased severity of extreme rainfall events make landslides more catastrophic as well as more frequent? How can we protect against these events? How can we develop better monitoring tools to watch for the early warning signs of future slope instability? How can we protect infrastructure against slope movements driven by climate change? By conducting laboratory experiments under highly controlled climate scenarios, Take is analyzing the soil behaviour that leads to landslides being triggered. He is also developing monitoring tools to observe landslide behaviour in the field.

What sovereign powers do countries apply along the margins of nation-states? What kinds of struggles over migration happen offshore? These are questions that capture the geographical imagination. As border enforcement moves increasingly offshore, islands are becoming important sites for negotiations over global migration. Every year, thousands of migrants are intercepted at sea while trying to reach sovereign territory and make a claim for asylum. Many are held in detention on islands, their legal status often unclear. Dr. Alison Mountz, Canada Research Chair in Global Migration, is examining the relationship between sovereignty and human migration. She is paying particular attention to the role that islands play in migrants’ efforts to enter sovereign territory. Mountz explores the tension between the forces, decisions and desires driving human migration, and the policies and practices designed to manage it. Her current research examines struggles surrounding border enforcement, asylum and detention. Preliminary data on asylum seekers detained in a limbo of time, location and law between nation-states highlight the fundamental questions driving Mountz’s research. Such detentions are often hidden from the view of media, the public and human rights monitors. Because of this, the perspectives of those involved in island encounters—civil servants, migrants, attorneys, not-for-profit organizations and advocates—are often underrepresented in debates about immigration and border enforcement. Mountz’s examination of the remote locations where border enforcement and detention take place will contribute significantly to discussions informing global migration policies. "

However, about 50 per cent of our brain is actually made up of many different types of fatty acids. While some of these fatty acids are bad, others are good—and may be beneficial in treating a number of serious brain conditions. Two particularly important fatty acids in the brain are docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and arachidonic acid (ARA). The two are essential in regulating mood, sleep, blood flow, and inflammation of the brain. DHA is found in foods like fish that contain high amounts of omega-3 fats. Research has found that people with diets rich in such fish have lower rates of serious brain conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease and bipolar (or “manic depressive”) disorder. Scientists believe DHA and ARA in the brain play strong roles in relation to these conditions. Dr. Richard Bazinet, Canada Research Chair in Brain Lipid Metabolism, is building on this knowledge by determining exactly how good and bad fatty acids enter the brain. Bazinet also intends to find out how the brain can be supplied with fatty acids made from plant-derived omega-3 fatty acids instead of fish, so as to not deplete the oceans’ natural fish stocks. In addition, he is examining how the brain uses fatty acids to fight inflammation and conditions like Alzheimer’s and bipolar disorder. With the understanding of both how fatty acids enter the brain and how they are metabolized in brain disorders, Bazinet aims to develop new brain-imaging techniques.

Many of Canada’s at-risk species are reaching their northern limits in southern Canada. These populations represent our best available sources of information on potential future shifts in animal and plant ranges. Scientists have been unable to extensively predict which species will prove capable of migration, keeping pace with climate change; or whether those species unable to move will persist by adaptation. To forecast such range shifts, scientists must first understand why different species are distributed across landscapes the way they are. To learn more about this, Dr. Amy L.

She and her research team are investigating the importance of ecological factors, such as weather, dispersal and competition, at different range edges. They are also investigating how genetic variations—the raw material for evolutionary change—vary among populations across such ranges.

But the technology isn’t quite there yet. Fortunately, Dr. Aimy Bazylak, Canada Research Chair in Thermofluidics for Clean Energy, is on the case. Bazylak’s goal is to address one of the trickiest challenges in using fuel cells effectively. A significant obstacle in using renewable energy sources (such as wind or sun) for clean electricity is that they are intermittent by nature, so the power they generate must be used or stored right away. To address this challenge, Bazylak and her research team are developing polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) fuel cells and electrolyzers. An electrolyzer generates power from still water by separating the water into hydrogen and oxygen, then feeding them into a fuel cell. The PEM electrolyzer can generate hydrogen for future use in PEM fuel cells. When paired with renewable energy sources, PEM fuel cells provide electricity with zero emissions. There’s a problem, though: fuel cell performance is compromised by water build-up. Bazylak’s goal is to design porous materials for use in fuel cells to avoid water build-up, in turn improving the efficiency and reducing the cost of PEM fuel cells and electrolyzers. If this works, Bazylak believes PEM fuel cells and electrolyzers have enormous potential to become practical sources of green energy for vehicles, off-grid communities and backup power. "

To address this challenge, renewable energy production will need to expand a thousandfold. The sun delivers more power to the Earth in an hour than the world uses in an entire year, so solar power is believed to be essential to future clean energy infrastructure. To make use of the sun’s energy, we need to develop novel materials that can efficiently convert sunlight into useable forms of energy on a large scale. As Canada Research Chair in Solar Energy Conversion, Dr. Curtis Berlinguette is designing new nanoscale materials that can turn sunlight into electricity, or even into clean fuels, such as hydrogen. Solar cells are currently too expensive and unreliable for widespread use, so Berlinguette and his research team are developing stable components for next-generation solar panels. But converting light into electricity is only half the battle. A storage solution is also needed to better match energy production to energy consumption. Inspired by the fact that a plant leaf can capture sunlight through photosynthesis and store the energy in chemical bonds, Berlinguette and his research team are developing catalysts to convert sunlight directly into hydrogen fuels.

A fundamental question in topology (the study of the properties that are preserved by deforming, twisting and stretching an object) is whether any two knots are the same. By untangling one—without cutting it—can you turn it into the second? This seemingly simple question can only be solved using highly sophisticated math. As Canada Research Chair in Mathematics, Dr. Sabin Cautis is exploring this problem and others like it to better understand fundamental questions in geometry and representation theory (the study of abstract algebraic structures). This enhanced comprehension of mathematical theories could lead to a more profound understanding of our universe. Techniques from representation theory can construct certain “invariants” of knots, which can distinguish some, but not all, knots. These invariants have been studied by theoretical physicists in connection with string theory—a subject that hopes to provide a working model for the universe by combining quantum mechanics and general relativity. Cautis and his research team are approaching the matter from a more philosophical perspective, using a new technique known as “categorification” to understand the deeper structures behind various theories. In mathematical terms, this means replacing vector spaces with more interesting and complex categories. Through this research, Cautis hopes to develop a deeper understanding of mathematical theories and what they can tell us about our universe. "

How long fog—and the reduced visibility it causes—lasts is determined by the properties of the atmospheric particles on which fog droplets form. Dr. Rachel Chang, Canada Research Chair in Atmospheric Science, is characterizing these to better understand how fog forms. Chang’s research will look at what role sea spray created by breaking waves in Canada’s oceans, including the Arctic, plays in the process. As melting sea ice exposes more ocean surface, particles from sea spray are becoming more common during the Arctic summers. Meanwhile, during Arctic winters, particles in the atmosphere originate from pollution in the south. Chang will examine these particles to better understand their sources, and how they make their way to the Canadian Arctic. Chang hopes her findings will serve as a baseline for studying how increasing industrial activity affects Arctic air quality, and lay the foundation for predicting air quality changes in the Arctic in the future. By increasing our understanding of how fog droplets form, her research could also improve visibility forecasting in Canada’s coastal areas. "

",Using Nutraceuticals to Improve Health," Using Nutraceuticals to Improve Health Nutraceuticals—such as unsaturated fatty acids, vitamins and antioxidants—are key in providing Canadians food that can help keep them healthy and reduce the incidence of chronic diseases. Foods that include nutraceuticals, such as omega-3-enhanced milk and probiotic yogurt, have become easier to find in recent years, but they aren’t always easy to produce. Dr. Lingyun Chen, Canada Research Chair in Plant Protein Structure Function and Nutraceutical Delivery, wants to eliminate the roadblocks that prevent the widespread production of these nutritionally enhanced foods. Nutraceuticals are vulnerable to changes in the environment during food production and storage, as well as to the adverse conditions of the human digestive system. Chen and her team are exploring using plant proteins—from common crops like barley, oats and pulses—to create plant-based delivery systems that are strong enough to withstand adverse conditions but can still be easily absorbed by the human body. By making it easier to include nutraceuticals in food products, Chen hopes to encourage Canadian public health strategies to place more emphasis on nutrition­—and improve Canadians’ health in the process.

These cycles are essentially pathways by which chemical substances can move through the Earth’s biosphere, lithosphere, atmosphere and hydrosphere. Micro-organisms can cause or accelerate these cycles—which, in turn, drive biological evolution and control conditions at Earth’s surface, including our climate. This co-evolution between life and the chemistry of the Earth’s surface is what created a planet that can support human and other complex life forms. In this sense, micro-organisms are agents of global change. As the Canada Research Chair in Geomicrobiology, Dr. Sean Crowe’s goal is to better understand the relationships between microbial life and the chemistry of the Earth’s surface. Crowe is making use of sensitive chemical analyses, computer modelling, state-of-the-art molecular microbiological tools, and experiments with bacterial growth to examine how microbial activity in the environment affects geochemistry. By pairing this knowledge with chemical analysis of geological samples, Crowe and his research team are reconstructing the co-evolution of life and Earth’s surface chemistry over billions of years. Crowe is also applying knowledge of microbial metabolism and geochemistry for better ecosystem management and to improve our ability to forecast environmental change.

Dr. Erick Delage, Canada Research Chair in Decision Making Under Uncertainty, develops models, rules and processes for decision-making software that can help leaders and managers deal with uncertainty. When companies, governments or individuals make complex decisions, it is often impossible for them to have a perfect understanding of the likely outcomes. For instance, the 2008 financial crisis exposed our inability to predict the far-reaching impact of certain economic choices. The good news is that new tools are constantly being developed to help us collect, store and process an ever-increasing pool of information about our operating environment. It is estimated that the volume of business data triples every two years. For example, in 2013, ebay.com accounted for 50 quadrillion bytes of data daily—all on its own. This means as a society, we face an information paradox: there is a growing amount of information available, yet it is almost impossible to fully predict the consequences of critical decisions. The key to addressing this issue is ensuring that people making critical decisions can successfully process the information they have, and find the best balance between risks and returns. With his research team, Delage develops cutting-edge tools that support critical decision making. These tools will make it easier for decision-makers in finance, revenue management, logistics, transportation and the environment to see the long-term impacts of their choices. "

Seventy-five per cent of the world’s children—1.5 billion of them—live in the 42 countries currently affected by armed conflict, while another 11.2 to 13.7 million have been internally displaced as a result of war. Living in an area affected by war often ruptures the fabric of life that supports healthy child development, severs family and community ties, and forces children to live in societies where basic social systems have been degraded or completely collapsed. As Canada Research Chair in Youth, Gender and Armed conflict, Dr. Myriam Denov is addressing key gaps in theory, methodology and service provision in this area. She is investigating the lasting effects of war on three poorly understood groups of children and their families: children born of wartime rape; former child soldiers and their reintegration into society following war; and children and families who face migration and resettlement as a result of war. Denov and her research team will explore children’s complex relationships and interactions with their families, schools and communities as well as with broader society. Denov’s goal is not only to uncover the long-term impacts of war on children and their families, but to provide a solid, pragmatic knowledge base for meeting their complex needs both during and after war.

As Canada Research Chair in Religion, Pluralism and the Rule of Law, Dr. Anver Emon wants to answer these essential questions, while critically analyzing why they matter and to whom. His research focuses on Sharia to better understand it as both a system of legal thought and an evolving tradition influencing today’s political landscape. While many scholars and policy analysts dismiss religion generally—and Islam specifically—as outdated, Emon believes this line of thinking is undemocratic and creates a culture of exclusion. Religious values, like those reflected in Islamic law, are important sources of value for many around the world, and Emon believes that criticisms of how they have informed political movements are not a good enough reason to reject them wholesale. His research uses the case of Islamic law as a vehicle to explore whether and how a commitment to “normative pluralism” (which views differences in values as a social good) enhances inclusion in democratic society.

In this sense, it is the visual study of shapes, sizes, patterns and positions in space. But, geometry is only the human brain’s way of interpreting the rules. Dr. David Favero, Canada Research Chair in Derived Categories, believes mathematical data, referred to as “derived categories”, may offer a more accurate interpretation of the universe’s real physical properties. To get at the heart of geometry, he and his collaborators are using the latest mathematical techniques to explore the rules of physical systems. Favero is applying “Kontsevich’s non-commutative algebraic geometry,” a field of research at the crossroads of modern math and high-energy theoretical physics. Through high-energy physics, researchers are trying to understand the nature of space and time, the forces determining the interactions between matter and energy, and the origins of elementary particles. Favero’s research focuses on the mathematical consequences of “phase transitions” in high-energy physics, or the transformation of physical models of the universe from one stable energy state to another. For example, when water changes into ice or steam, it crosses an energy threshold, and its properties and symmetries sometimes changing drastically. Favero is also studying “mirror symmetry” between geometric objects, and is looking for a mathematical explanation for this phenomenon. Mirror symmetry predicts that some geometric shapes will have the same physical properties, but seen in a different way.

It is the region’s rural nature and charm that attracts many tourists. But its rural character also has resulted in some serious challenges, such as a shrinking and aging population, decaying infrastructure, and the decline and disappearance of key industries. Stimulating economic growth is often seen as a solution to these problems. But current research suggests there are ecological limits and consequences to economic growth. As Canada Research Chair in Sustainable Rural Futures for Atlantic Canada, Dr. Karen Foster will examine the tension between economic health and sustainability in the region. Scientists believe human activity—and economic growth in particular—is a primary cause of global warming. There is increasing interest in the idea of transforming our society and economy using “degrowth” measures—that is, ecological economics strategies that would have us consume less, produce less, and live on a more local scale. This presents rural communities with a conundrum: economic growth is often deemed essential to their survival, but could threaten their long-term sustainability. Using case studies and regional surveys, Foster will explore the potential of degrowth strategies in rural Atlantic Canada. She will also address the contradictions between rural ways of thinking, living and working and the kinds of changes degrowth would entail. Ultimately, Foster’s research will increase the understanding of alternative vision of sustainability in rural communities. "

If scientists could prevent HIV entry, the virus would not be able to multiply. Dr. Andrés Finzi, Canada Research Chair in Retroviral Entry, hopes that, by improving our understanding of how HIV enters human cells, his research will shed light on how to stop HIV infection before the virus can infect cells. To multiply and to infect a host, HIV must first penetrate cells using a specific “key” that recognizes a corresponding “lock” on the surface of certain human cells. For infection to happen, this viral key—the HIV envelope glycoproteins (“Env”) that attach themselves to the cell’s membrane—also has to “turn.” To do so, the glycoproteins must change their shape and structure to enable the virus to fuse with the target cell. By gaining insight into the changes Env undergoes during HIV entry, Finzi hopes to support the development of new antigens that evoke immune responses in order to produce antibodies that can fight Env. He also hopes to identify small molecule inhibitors that could block Env before the virus can enter the cell. Better understanding this crucial stage in the HIV replication cycle could not only lead to the identification of new therapeutic targets (vulnerable sites on HIV-1 Env that can be targeted to block HIV-1-infection), but could also help in developing vaccines.

Nonrenewable fossil fuels continue to supply the bulk of global electricity needs, but there is an increasing desire to move towards renewable power generation, for its environmental benefits. The challenge is integrating renewable energy sources into existing grid infrastructures. Dr. Ngai-Man (Carl) Ho, Canada Research Chair in Efficient Utilization of Electric Power, wants to make this transition easier by developing efficient grid infrastructures and grid-connected apparatuses that will reduce energy consumption from traditional power plants. By integrating emerging power electronics converters and modern communication techniques, Ho hopes to provide low-voltage grid infrastructures, and to support demand-side management techniques (changing consumer demand for energy) to minimize energy losses, reduce technical inefficiencies, and support the switch to renewable energy sources. Ho’s past research into grid-connected converters for renewable energy has been used around the world to develop industrial products such as solar inverters, uninterrupted power supplies, and electronic dimmers. Ho hopes his research will enable the Canadian electrical industry to develop technologies and products that support the next generation of intelligent energy grids, and ensure Canada maintains its competitive position in the global energy industry.

As Canada Research Chair in Consumer Behaviour, Dr. Jo Andrea Hoegg is trying to understand the impact of these marketing efforts on consumers’ thoughts, emotions and behaviours. The ubiquity of marketing communications creates fear among consumers that corporations have too much power and behave in ways that are not in consumers’ best interests. For companies, the overwhelming amount of marketing information out there has made it increasingly difficult to gain consumers’ attention. How can they attract customers in a crowded marketplace? How can they build relationships with customers when consumers increasingly shop online? Using research methods from cognitive psychology, social psychology and marketing, Hoegg hopes to address these issues and generate insights that will benefit both consumers and companies. Hoegg and her research team will look at the impact that subtle changes to a company’s marketing program—such as product features, the ordering of product offerings, and sales interactions—can have on consumer judgments, choices and loyalty. Her findings will help companies build stronger relationships with customers. They will also provide consumers with a better understanding of how they are influenced by marketing communications, as well as strategies to better negotiate the marketplace. "

Despite decades of research on brain anatomy and function, scientists still understand remarkably little about how the brain evolves, why its anatomy varies from species to species, and when in the past major changes occurred. These are some of the questions Dr. Andrew Iwaniuk, Canada Research Chair in Comparative Neuroanatomy, aims to answer. Many theories have been proposed to answer these questions, but most have been based on a small number of species—so it’s not clear whether findings can be applied to other animals. Using digital imaging and the largest animal brain collection in Canada, Iwaniuk and his research team are testing whether these theories can reliably explain how and why brains vary from one species to the next. In addition, Iwaniuk is developing new ways of analyzing anatomical brain differences, and new resources to enable other researchers to better understand brain anatomy. Iwaniuk’s research will also identify when major brain changes have occurred in evolution. For example, did changes in birds’ brains enable them to fly? By collaborating with other labs, he is also examining the brains of extinct species, such as dinosaurs. This research provides valuable information on how the brain has evolved, as well as insights into species’ behaviours. By establishing how the brain evolves, what changes have occurred over time, and why these changes were necessary, Iwaniuk’s research is playing a key role in our modern understanding of brain function.

Many new genetic variations associated with psychiatric disorders have been identified recently, but exactly how they lead to neuropsychiatric disease remains unknown—and is the subject of research by Dr. Sébastien Jacquemont, Canada Research Chair in Genetics of Neuropsychiatric Disorders. Jacquemont’s research focuses on families with rare genetic mutations that lead to neurodevelopmental disorders like autism, schizophrenia, speech and language impairment, or learning disabilities. These disorders affect more than 5 percent of the general population, and are a significant public health burden. Jacquemont and his research team are investigating how genetic mutations change cognition, behavior and energy balance in these patients by measuring their effects and studying how they shift according to different family backgrounds and environments. Jacquemont is interested in general patterns of cognitive and behavioral difficulties rather than in a single specific diagnosis. This is because the criteria that currently define neuropsychiatric diagnoses do not capture the whole spectrum of associated disorders or disabilities. Establishing cohorts of individuals carrying specific mutations offers a promising way to study common neuropsychiatric diseases. Ultimately, this research could lead to successful treatments targeting specific mechanisms involved in neuropsychiatric disorders. "

Yet appropriate action could narrow these differences. As Canada Research Chair in Global Health, Dr. Prabhat Jha wants to study the death rates and causes to improve the health of the living in developing countries. Jha leads the Indian Million Death Study (MDS), one of the world’s largest studies of human health. The study monitors 14 million people in India in two million homes. Its findings have already spurred government action on tobacco, as well as on childhood and infectious diseases. By deepening the analysis of child and adult mortality to cover a wider range of possible causes, Jha will develop new tools and methods to apply the study’s approach to other populations in Asia, Africa and Latin America. For example, he will document the hazards of smoking and benefits of quitting in the United States, Canada, Mexico and elsewhere. Jha and his research team will conduct blood-based epidemiological studies and quantify the hazards of smoking, alcohol consumption and obesity worldwide. He will also conduct randomized trials to gauge the effectiveness of public health messages promoting disease control. His research will contribute to a goal proposed to the United Nations to reduce global premature mortality by 40 per cent by 2030 (compared to 2010 rates). If achieved, this goal would avoid approximately 18 million premature deaths around the world. "

When treating children with disabilities, it can mean involving families in decision-making, sharing information, and being responsive to their priorities and choices. Family-centred care can lower parental stress and is associated with better psychological health and well-being among both parents and children. There is also evidence that it positively affects children’s development. But despite widespread agreement about the benefits of family-centred care, there have been difficulties in implementing it. Dr. Gillian King, Canada Research Chair in Optimal Care for Children with Disabilities, wants to improve how care is delivered to children with disabilities and their families. A pre-eminent childhood disability researcher, she is universally regarded as one of the foremost authorities on the psychosocial aspects of care. King has three goals. First, she will investigate how families and youth engage in the care process. Second, she will improve the features usually included in intervention programs.

For example, poverty or adverse family environments early in life are linked to mental and physical health problems in adults. In many cases, it can take years, even decades, before these early experiences manifest in the form of disease. Dr. Michael Kobor, Canada Research Chair in Social Epigenetics, is investigating how these early experiences “get under the skin” via epigenetic marks. These epigenetic marks act as “dimmer switches,” fine-tuning levels of gene expression. Kobor hopes to discover how early life experiences alter these marks, leading to changes in gene expression that influence health and behaviour over a person’s life. For example, he is examining populations of children and adults to understand whether poverty or abuse in childhood can change the brain’s biology, resulting in conditions such as depression, aggression or addiction. Kobor and his research team are using an interdisciplinary approach, working in close partnership with child development, psychology and epidemiology researchers on collaborative projects across Canada and around the world. Their work will allow us to better understand how gene–environment interactions lead to lifelong inequalities in health outcomes, and could lead to the development of interventions that target at-risk populations.

Today, quantum mechanics is behind many of the technologies powering modern life—from transistors that enable complex calculations in the stock market to digital image-capture technologies in cameras. Dr. Lindsay LeBlanc, Canada Research Chair in Ultracold Gases for Quantum Simulation, is fascinated by the complexity of quantum mechanics: predicting how so many particles will act together is difficult or impossible for even the most advanced computers. Like people grouped together in communities, when quantum particles are close to each other, they show traits differing from their usual, individual ones—a phenomenon scientists call “many-body” behaviour. Once understood, these behaviours can be applied in practical scientific advances, such as exponentially more powerful quantum computers. LeBlanc and her research team use laser-cooled quantum gases to better examine what sets off many-body behaviour. By cooling the atoms, they can slow their movement and cause them to overlap slightly, setting off the many-body behaviour for observation. LeBlanc’s research could be used to design and manufacture the next generation of devices that use many-body behaviour. "

Each year, some 80,000 Canadians experience a first heart attack, or myocardial infarction. Half experience no warning signs or symptoms, and more than a third die before reaching medical care. There are proven clinical tools that can predict the risk of future heart attack on a population level, but they are not as effective on an individual level, often misclassifying patients. Dr. Jonathon Leipsic, Canada Research Chair in Advanced Cardiopulmonary Imaging, hopes to improve this situation. Through large-scale international collaborations, he and his research team are studying the mechanisms of acute myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death while examining heart and lung interactions that may influence patients’ outcomes. Leipsic’s team is evaluating very large, non-invasive imaging data sets to better understand their ability to predict coronary plaque characteristics. (Plaque accumulates in arteries and can clog them, leading to heart disease.) His team will also investigate gender-specific differences in these plaques before the onset of heart attacks to develop a model that can predict the risk of heart attack for both men and women. Ultimately, this work—along with Leipsic’s other major focus on structural heart disease—will play a major role in helping us understand coronary artery disease risk. It will also significantly improve physicians’ ability to perform minimally invasive heart disease therapies guided by innovative imaging technology. "

",Keeping the Bad Guys Out: Managing Invasive Aquatic Species," Keeping the Bad Guys Out: Managing Invasive Aquatic Species Alien species—plants, animals and micro-organisms from one part of the world that become established in another—are one of the biggest threats to global biodiversity. The Great Lakes have been invaded by at least 180 different alien species to date, and our oceans face an increasing number of harmful invaders. These species disrupt food chains, and cause economic damage. Canada is working hard to prevent new alien species from being introduced, and is setting up early detection programs. But, detecting aquatic invaders early enough to make a difference is difficult: their numbers are usually very low at first, and it is hard to notice a new species in water. Dr. Hugh MacIsaac, Canada Research Chair in Aquatic Invasive Species, is exploring molecular techniques to detect alien species in a number of vulnerable ecosystems across Canada. These techniques identify species by their DNA patterns, rather than using microscopes. MacIsaac and his research team are collecting water from ports, then extracting and sequencing the available DNA. Then, they compare the DNA sequences with databases, to identify species. The risk of an invasion by an alien species is determined by the number of species introduced, as well as by how plentiful they are when released—usually by ships—into Canadian waters. Using ballast water from ships arriving at Canadian ports, MacIsaac and his team are identifying the ships and shipping routes that pose the greatest threats. MacIsaac’s work will help Canada better manage arriving ships, to reduce the overall number of alien species successfully colonizing Canadian waters. "

Explaining the close connection between our living environments and social inequalities is at the core of Dr. Jeffrey Masuda’s research. As Canada Research Chair in Environmental Health Equity, Masuda works closely with marginalized populations in inner cities, documenting their efforts to create healthier neighbourhoods for themselves and their families. Masuda’s research offers an alternate view of Canada’s inner cities, viewing them as areas that also have positive aspects. His work has shown that people who face social prejudices—like racism, homophobia, and mental health stigmas—view their neighbourhoods as refuges from persecution and sources of mutual support, cultural safety, and acceptance.

The failure was caused by fast-moving floodwaters scouring near one the bridge piers. A rail company spokesman said the vulnerability had not been detected despite several inspections, because the scouring was at the bottom of the bridge, where inspection and detection were impossible. His statement reflects the difficulties involved in inspecting critical, vulnerable infrastructure using conventional methods. Research by Dr. Sriram Narasimhan, Canada Research Chair in Smart Infrastructure, aims to detect such failures automatically through the use of sensors and smart data acquisition technology. Such technology would permit structures to be evaluated with confidence, and catastrophic failures predicted before they happen. Our ability to collect information using sensors has far surpassed our ability to manage, interpret, and act on that data in a timely manner to prevent catastrophes. To this end, Narasimhan is developing theoretical concepts to extract meaningful information from measured data, developing computer algorithms for implementation, and conducting experimental studies in the laboratory and the field.

As Canada Research Chair in Entrepreneurial Innovation and the Public Good, Dr. Theodore Noseworthy wants to increase consumer acceptance of innovative products by increasing our understanding of how we make sense of innovation. Combining cognitive psychology with economic theory, Noseworthy hopes to learn more about how receptive consumers are to innovations in three specific areas: consumer behaviour and new consumer markets; food innovation; and the connection between new currency and consumption. For example, Noseworthy’s research on radical disruptive innovations—such as the LCD or plasma televisions that replaced the old tube televisions—will increase our understanding of how consumer behavior influences the creation of new markets. His food innovation research will shed light on the factors affecting consumer choices with regard to junk foods that are marketed as healthy. His third area of research will explore whether changing Canadian money from paper to polymer is influencing our consumption habits. The knowledge generated by Noseworthy’s research will not only help marketers find ways to encourage consumers to adopt innovative goods and services, but will also educate businesses, policymakers and consumers about the costs of innovation for susceptible consumers and society.

Plants are continuously exposed to a number of environmental stressors that can limit their growth or even cause their death. These include high salinity, drought and extreme temperatures—all serious challenges that can affect the distribution of crops and diminish their performance worldwide to as little as 20 per cent of their potential. Global climate change will amplify these challenges, making stress resistance in crops essential to the world's ability to feed itself.

More specifically, they are exploring the mechanisms that help plant cells maintain their structural integrity during periods of stress. They are also identifying the cellular components that help plant cells adapt to adverse conditions.

",Using Worms to Identify Potential New Drugs for Humans," Using Worms to Identify Potential New Drugs for Humans Since the turn of the century, researchers have gained access to an explosion of new technologies and reagents (compounds or mixtures, usually composed of inorganic or small organic molecules) to study. For example, libraries of drug-like small molecules, once available only to large pharmaceutical companies, are now accessible to academic researchers. As Canada Research Chair in Chemical Genetics, Dr. Peter Roy is using these libraries to pinpoint drug-like small molecules that could be used to treat human disorders. To do this, Roy and his research team are modelling human conditions in tiny nematode worms called Caenorhabditis elegans. The disease is created in the worms, and then libraries of drug-like molecules are screened to identify those that can “cure” the disease. Because the worms are tiny and grow quickly, it is possible to screen millions of mutant worms rapidly to see if any of the drug-like molecules are helping them resist the effects of the disease. Whole-genome sequencing (a laboratory process that determines the complete DNA sequence of an organism's genome) can then identify the genetic mutation in the worms that confers this resistance. This information can help researchers identify potential biological targets for new drugs. Since much of the worm’s biology is similar to that of humans, Roy’s research could increase our understanding of human biology. It could also result in the discovery of new drug-like molecules that have the potential to treat roundworm infections, mood disorders, conditions affecting the neurons in the human brain, and other human diseases.

One way to do this is through electron cryomicroscopy (cryo-EM), a new method that has the potential to revolutionize biology. Dr. John Rubinstein, Canada Research Chair in Electron Cryomicroscopy, is a pioneer in this exciting new field. Because it relies on freezing, cryo-EM offers unique advantages over other approaches to microscopy. For example, conventional optical microscopy uses light and lenses to create an image, while electron microscopy uses a beam of electrons. For electron microscopy to work, the sample must be prepared properly, often by staining it with heavy metals or fixing it with chemicals, altering the sample somewhat from its original state. But in cryo-EM, the sample is frozen, allowing it to be seen in a state much closer to its native one. As a result, cryo-EM lets scientists analyze things that were previously impossible to study. Rubinstein and his research team are developing cryo-EM tools and using them to understand a type of enzyme called rotary ATPases. These enzymes supply energy to cells and control the acidity of certain compartments within them. As well as developing tools that will be useful to the entire structural biology community, Rubinstein’s investigation into ATPases may enable us to target them in treating certain diseases, including cancer and osteoporosis.

",How Can Nano Lead to More Powerful Technology?," How Can Nano Lead to More Powerful Technology? Over the past half-century, computer manufacturers could count on processing speed and memory capacity to double nearly every two years, thanks to steady advances in the miniaturization of electronic components. But lately, the pace of these advances has been slowing as we approach the fundamental limit, with transistors nearing the size of single molecules. With greater demand for miniature medical diagnostic tools and portable or wearable electronics, scientists like Dr. Dvira Segal, Canada Research Chair in Theoretical Chemistry, are looking for ways to give smaller devices a power boost. The challenge is that small devices rely on nanotechnology—the manipulation of atoms and molecules on a scale so small they can't be seen with an ordinary microscope. The smaller things are, the more complex they become. We do not yet have a full understanding of how energy is transmitted at the nanoscale, but this knowledge is crucial for turning molecules and atoms into workable devices. To overcome this challenge, Segal and her research team are studying how electrical charges and potentially destructive heat are transmitted at the molecular level. Segal is developing computational techniques that will help nanodevice manufacturers understand the basic laws of this tiny world. Her research will help establish guidelines that predict how well molecules conduct electrons and get rid of heat, which could lead to new principles for technologies. Segal’s research into the dynamics of molecular systems could also result in important advances in communications, medicine, manufacturing and other areas. "

Many of these landscapes contain permafrost (ground that is permanently frozen for at least two consecutive years) under a layer that thaws seasonally. But these layers are also changing as the climate does. It is believed that the layers that thaw seasonally are becoming thicker and more degraded in northern permafrost regions. This could eventually lead to the complete disappearance of permafrost along the southern limit of its current distribution. In other words, the permafrost could start to recede further and further north. As Canada Research Chair in Atmospheric Biogeosciences at High Latitude Dr. Oliver Sonnentag is studying how ecosystems function as these changes occur. The disappearance of permafrost in Canada’s sub-arctic and arctic landscapes would alter water and carbon cycles and the composition, structure and functioning of high-latitude ecosystems. Together with the projected increase in the frequency and intensity of disturbances like fires, this could lead to significant changes to the characteristics of land surfaces and increase greenhouse gas emissions. To measure net carbon, water and heat exchanges at the ecosystem scale, Sonnentag and his research team are establishing a regional network of four micro-meteorological towers along a permafrost gradient across the Taiga Plains in the Northwest Territories. Ultimately, their research will lead to a better understanding of Canada’s most vulnerable landscapes and support future laws to promote climate change adaptation. "

Ecologists use this information to understand biodiversity and why species live where they do. This knowledge helps us address environmental problems, such as which areas should be prioritized for conservation, or how climate change may affect where species can or cannot survive. We tend to think of biodiversity in terms of plants and animals. But the vast majority of biodiversity on our planet is actually microbial. Plants and animals are just two lineages of eukaryotes (cells with organized nuclei), while the remaining 70-plus are diverse microbes. Collectively, these microbes are called protists. Because protists cannot be seen by the naked eye, we know little about their distribution or even how many species exist. This lack of knowledge is striking, because protists have huge impacts on aquatic ecosystems, influencing energy production in living organisms as well as the flow of nutrients and energy. Additionally, the diverse protists that live in the human gut have profound influences on human health. As Canada Research Chair in Protist Ecology, Dr. Laura Wegener Parfrey will use genomic data to characterize protist biodiversity to address this gap in our knowledge. Parfrey also aims to better understand the factors responsible for these biodiversity patterns, and in turn how changing environmental conditions alter microbial diversity.

Meanwhile, those who do can face life-threatening medical complications after surgery. With a focus on infants, Dr. Lori West, Canada Research Chair in Cardiac Transplantation, is improving the odds for transplant patients. Thanks to West’s research, physicians already have a better understanding of how infants can accept heart transplants from donors with incompatible blood types. In many cases, infants no longer need to wait for a perfect match before receiving a transplant. The results have been shorter waitlists and better survival rates for other babies waiting for new hearts. West and her research team draw on immunology, chemistry, cell biology and animal model studies, and are applying their findings in translational and clinical research. They are continuing to discover more about infants’ immune responses to organ transplants, especially their ability to receive a transplanted organ without rejecting it. One of West’s aims is to prepare infants to tolerate a heart transplant from an incompatible blood type, either while still in the womb or just after birth. Inducing tolerance could reduce, or even eliminate, the lifelong need for immunosuppressant drugs used to prevent their bodies from rejecting the transplanted heart. West also hopes to increase organ donation rates and improve the success of transplants across Canada.

More generally, almost everyone has experienced a lack of time at some point. According to research by Dr. Jiaying Zhao, Canada Research Chair in Behavioural Sustainability, scarcity does not only signify a lack of resources—it also presents challenging psychological demands on a person. Zhao’s research has shown that scarcity can hinder cognitive function, which in itself may worsen the condition of scarcity. Zhao and her research team are identifying how scarcity leads to neglect; what consequences arise from scarcity of environmental resources, such as food or water; how scarcity can result in failure to engage in environmental action; and how resource inequality induces the experience of scarcity. This research will lay new theoretical, empirical and methodological ground for a science of scarcity. It will not only further our understanding of scarcity and its resulting cognitive and behavioural consequences, but also provide fundamental insights on human behaviour and decision-making that emerge from the psychology of scarcity.

They also form the base of food webs that support our fisheries. Just like humans, phytoplankton require a host of micronutrients to grow, such as iron, zinc and vitamins. They can also become malnourished if they are deprived of them. Whether phytoplankton thrive or starve hinges, in part, on who their neighbors are. They depend on specialized bacteria around them to produce essential micronutrients, like vitamin B12, but they also compete with those same bacteria for other scarce micronutrients, like iron and zinc. In turn, bacteria rely on the carbon that phytoplankton produce to fuel their growth.

Unfortunately, the software currently used for these calculations relies on trial and error, which can cause delays in starting treatment. By analyzing data from prostate cancer patients, Chan is developing new methods of predicting the best treatment parameters to use in the planning stages of radiation treatment. He believes including more patient-specific information in the planning process will not only personalize the treatments, but will make the process more efficient. Chan’s ultimate goal is to improve wait times and make treatments more personalized and efficient for patients who are undergoing radiation therapy for cancer. "

In Canada, this exposure is responsible for $3.6 to $9.1 billion in health care costs each year. Animal studies have found that many common contaminants affect hormones or the immune system, and may also have profound effects on the health and development of children. But human data are lacking. As Canada Research Chair in Environmental Health Sciences,Dr. Jonathan Chevrier wants to help fill this information gap by identifying and understanding the risks associated with exposure to environmental contaminants in children and other vulnerable populations in North America and around the world, with the ultimate goal of reducing those risks. Chevrier and his research team will investigate the effects of a number of chemicals commonly detected in humans, including pesticides, plastic components, flame retardants and other persistent pollutants, based on studies conducted in Canada, the United States and South Africa. They will also investigate the link between exposure to these chemicals and hormone levels, as well as effects on the immune system, such as the body’s response to vaccines and allergens. Chevrier’s research will provide crucial information to help both policy-makers and the public make informed choices about managing and regulating chemicals that could harm our health. "

We expect students to know how to use computers both in and out of the classroom. When digital technology first became popular, there was a gap between lower- and higher-income students’ ability to gain access to technology. But today, the ""digital divide"" is more linked to how young people use it. As Canada Research Chair in Sociocultural Issues of Digital Technology in Education, Dr. Simon Collin studies the relationships between students’ sociocultural backgrounds and their ability to learn with digital technology in and out of school. His work combines proven, rigorous collection and analysis methods that stem from recent technological developments.

In Canada, shoulder impairments cost the health care system nearly $1 billion per year—and that doesn’t include costs related to lost productivity. Equally important are the loss of autonomy and reduced quality of life suffered by people with shoulder injuries. Using techniques from mathematics, biology, physics and engineering, Dr. Clark Dickerson, Canada Research Chair in Shoulder Mechanics, is searching for ways to prevent shoulder injuries before they happen. By combining the study of shoulder tissue tolerances with high-fidelity computerized simulations, Dickerson and his research team are developing new cross-disciplinary solutions to eliminate and mitigate shoulder damage. They are doing this by looking at how consumer product manufacturing, user-centred product design, and workplace layouts can influence shoulder health. Dickerson and his team are also investigating the impact of other factors on shoulder integrity, such as compensatory movements, muscular fatigue and aging. Dickerson’s research has the potential to improve our understanding of the fundamental causes of shoulder damage.

Photonic devices are structures that let scientists manipulate how light is transmitted and control the way it interacts with matter. An integrated optical circuit is a photonic device that integrates multiple information signals composed of light of various wavelengths. Dr. Ksenia Dolgaleva, Canada Research Chair in Integrated Photonics, is investigating the use of integrated photonics and integrated optical circuits for optical communication systems and quantum optics (a field of quantum physics that deals specifically with how photons interact with matter). In most cases, signal processing in optical communications is electronic. However, photonic integration will enable all-optical signal processing. Dolgaleva and her research team are working to develop the integrated optical components needed to make all-optical photonic circuits a reality. Ultimately, her research will lead to the invention of novel photonics-integrated circuits for all-optical communications and quantum information networks. This would better equip networks to handle the quickly growing data traffic. Dolgaleva's research is also expected to have applications in other areas, such as health care, where photonic integration is a high priority.

They threaten water safety, and can cause serious infections in humans and animals. Some of these bacteria have also developed resistance to drugs, making currently available treatments ineffective. As Canada Research Chair in Molecular Ecology of Waterborne Microbes, Dr. Tao Dong’s goal is to understand the molecular mechanisms by which microbes survive and persist in the environment. Microbes face challenges that include stress, attacks by protists (a collection of single-celled organisms), and competition from other bacterial species. As a result, they have developed multiple strategies to gain or defend territory and to differentiate friends from foe. This gives them the ability to survive and fight off predators, as well as to be readily transmitted to a host. Dong and his research team are identifying the key gene functions that microbes need to defend and attack. Their research will focus on a number of important pathogens, including the foodborne bacterium E. coli O157:H7, Vibrio cholerae (Cholera), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (a major cause of hospital-acquired infections). By understanding how microbes protect themselves and attack others, Dong’s research will reveal important gene targets for screening new antimicrobial compounds. It could also lead to the development of new tools to limit the spread of pathogens and to control infections that are resistant to antibiotics "

This complex matter is made of fluid molecules with long-chain structures. Modern rheological research is all about understanding and connecting chain structure with chain motions and alignments. Rheologists uncover these connections by carefully jiggling the molecules found in plastics and resins, in expensive and sophisticated computerized instruments called rheometers.

His research team is also exploring the role rheology plays in polymer processing and in plastics manufacturing. Since flowing polymer molecules are too small to see, combining experimental rheology with detailed intricate theory about what the molecules might be doing can uncover stunningly beautiful mathematical structure to explain the curious, often counterintuitive, flow behaviours of complex liquids. For instance, while water flows away from a rotating rod, elastic liquids will climb this same rod, because their molecular chains “remember” their past shapes. Rheologists study the mysterious physics underlying such phenomena. The prosperity of Canada’s plastics processing industry relies on how deeply we can understand molecular motions in complex fluids, and on how well we can apply this understanding.

Golab and his research team are developing software tools for analyzing the data generated by smart electricity and water meters. They are also analyzing social media to find ways to reduce barriers to adopting green technologies, such as electric cars. The following example is an easy way to understand Golab’s work. Suppose a consumer noticed he was using a lot of electricity, but didn’t know why. He could use a smart meter data mining system developed by Golab’s research team to compare his usage to his neighbour’s. If his consumption was much higher, an obvious conclusion would be that a high-consumption appliance or other device was being plugged in all the time. With this information, the consumer could solve the problem by finding the problem appliance and turning it off or replacing it. By developing tools like this, Golab’s team hopes to reduce our use of resources. Reducing resource consumption, especially during peak times, will also minimize utility costs for consumers, and reduce the need for Canada to expand its electricity grid and water supply networks.

In the past, our knowledge of specific immune mechanisms was limited to studying cells and pathogens in a petri dish. Although this taught us a lot, it was almost impossible to study the complex interactions between immune cells and the infection within the living host. But more recently, researchers have developed imaging technology that lets us look directly within living tissues and blood vessels to study how immune cells recognize, respond to, and clear pathogens. Dr. Craig Jenne, Canada Research Chair in Imaging Approaches Towards Studying Infection, will use this imaging technology to identify how pathogens inflict tissue damage and how the immune system responds to it.

Her research will also shed light on the relationship between private rights and state authority. Since private and public rights are mutually dependent, her idea is that public goals may be achieved not only by regulating harmful behaviour, but by delegating the responsibility for outcomes to private individuals—for example, making property owners responsible for cleaning up contaminants on their property, even if they were not themselves the polluters. Katz’s research will explore the legal area where private rights and the state’s rights collide. Her research has significant academic and policy implications. "

Osteoarthritis, the most common form, occurs when cartilage wears away. In most parts of the body, adult stem cells counteract this normal wear and tear by helping to repair tissues. But the cartilage in joints lacks the stem cells necessary to make this happen. Without any built-in mechanism of recovery when cartilage breaks down in individuals with osteoarthritis, the result is chronic pain, stiffness, and inflammation. As Canada Research Chair in Bone and Joint Stem Cell Biology, Dr. Roman Krawetz is looking at how regenerative medical techniques could help repair cartilage. Krawetz and his research team are investigating the relationship between inflammation within the joint and how stem cells behave. Understanding this relationship may allow us to enhance the natural repair capacity of the patient’s own stem cells by controlling the inflammatory response. Krawetz has already published data showing that the intensity and nature of the inflammation in arthritic joints is linked to stem cells’ inability to generate and repair cartilage. He hopes his current research will identify ways to harness and direct stem cells’ anti-inflammatory and regenerative capacities, and ultimately, contribute to developing new pharmaceuticals and patient-derived cell-based therapies to restore cartilage damaged by injury or osteoarthritis.

But beyond that, it can be an engaging and accessible means of exploring critical contemporary issues and concepts. Dr. Larissa Lai is a novelist, poet, critic, and associate professor of creative writing who is interested in exploring the concept of utopia, especially in relation to aesthetic innovation and social and ecological justice. As Canada Research Chair in Creative Writing, Lai’s work has two related foci. It includes writing Grist, the first novel in a planned trilogy about a future in which a terrible disease leads to some surprisingly positive mutations. Meanwhile, Lai is also developing The Insurgent Architect’s House for Creative Writing (TIA House), a part of the University of Calgary’s English Department. TIA House will focus on social justice and aesthetic innovation as sources of new forms and methods for fiction, poetry, and experimental writing. In her work and at TIA House, Lai is interested in the concept of “critical utopia” where, rather than designing the future, the focus is on gathering stories, poetry, ideas, texts, and more to nudge the future in a more serendipitous direction. As part of the TIA House, which is grounded in indigenous, GLBTQ, African Canadian, Asian Canadian, ecologically conscious, and disability communities, Lai is committed to international experimental and avant-garde practices. Through the centre’s collaborative critical and creative projects, a reading series, and an interdisciplinary talk series, her work will generate new relationships and forms in contemporary writing, and change our thinking about what the future can be.

As Canada Research Chair in Ecotoxicogenomics and Endocrine Disruption, Dr. Valerie Langlois is trying to determine the effects of these environmental contaminants on the health of vertebrates. Langlois and her research team are specifically interested in studying chemicals that mimic human hormones. For example, one of the chemicals needed to make plastic can mimic the female hormone estrogen, sneaking into the body and disrupting normal functions. These small molecular intruders can also be very damaging to wildlife. Langlois’ research focuses on how these hormone-mimicking chemicals operate and interact with vertebrates’ physiological functions. She and her team are also developing new diagnostic tools to measure these environmental health stressors and provide better data to Canadian health-regulating agencies.

These circuits serve as the brain’s wiring, enabling us to see, move and speak. But how does this happen? And what if this circuitry isn’t “wired” correctly? As Canada Research Chair in Developmental Neural Circuitry, Dr. Julie Lefebvre will explore the developmental and molecular mechanisms that form the connections between neurons—the circuits within the brain. Even small changes in neural wiring can affect complex brain functions such as speech and learning. She hopes her research will shed light on how defects in these connections contribute to the development of brain disorders like autism, epilepsy and schizophrenia. Lefebvre and her research team will use cutting-edge microscopy and genetic technologies in mouse models to examine and manipulate nerve cells in the developing brain and retina. This will allow them to investigate how neural circuits are built from a wide variety of cell types, and why their proper organization is critical for neural function. By better understanding these mechanisms, Lefebvre hopes to bridge the gap between identifying genes associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, and understanding the impact on the development and function of brain circuits.

(Emerging markets are those that are considered less developed than the major economies of North America or Western Europe, such as Brazil, India, Russia and China.) As Canada Research Chair in Global Investment Strategy, Dr. Jing Li is studying the global investment strategies of emerging market firms to better understand how they succeed. A primary focus of Li’s research is how political relations affect these firms’ international investment strategies. This is an important consideration because some emerging market governments are involved in developing other countries’ infrastructures. For example, the Chinese government provides substantial aid to African countries. Li’s research is also concerned with how some multinational firms, especially those in emerging economies, are not always perceived as legitimate: for example, factors such as little or no technological innovation, or state ownership, can work against them. Li is examining the obstacles these firms must overcome and how they can adapt their strategies accordingly. Li’s work will advance international business research, and has practical implications for firms and policy makers looking to attract investment in Canada from emerging market firms.

",Enhancing Brain Plasticity to Improve Hearing," Enhancing Brain Plasticity to Improve Hearing Hearing loss profoundly affects a person’s quality of life. It is socially isolating, restricts career opportunities, and hastens cognitive decline in later life. In Canada, hearing loss is one of the most common birth defects, chronic disabilities, and complaints of the elderly. Yet little is known about what happens to the brain as a consequence of deafness. Dr. Stephen G. Lomber, Canada Research Chair in Brain Plasticity and Development, studies how the brain changes after hearing loss in childhood or adulthood. Specifically, he studies the regions of the brain that process sounds in individuals who can hear, and the changes that take place in these areas following hearing loss. The brain’s ability to change is known as “plasticity.” Plastic changes in the brain help deaf individuals make better use of their remaining senses, such as sight and touch. Understanding the natural limits of brain plasticity will help researchers develop methods to overcome them, and will promote increased brain plasticity. In turn, this could lead to better hearing devices, such as cochlear implants. Cochlear implants are extremely effective at providing sound sensations to deaf individuals, and can also make it possible for them to understand speech. A better understanding of how the plasticity of the cerebral cortex changes after cochlear implantation could make the implants even more effective and lead to greater success in improving hearing in both children and the elderly.

Dr. Michael Lounsbury, Canada Research Chair in Entrepreneurship and Innovation, is examining how entrepreneurial ventures are created, how they succeed, and how they can help solve social problems, grow new markets, and attract investment. Lounsbury is particularly interested in how a startup’s entrepreneurial processes are shaped by its community and location. For instance, some startups have a more elaborate operating environment and infrastructure; some embrace a more risk-taking entrepreneurial culture; and some have better access to capital than others. Entrepreneurs are often challenged by the need to play multiple roles as they grow their organizations. For instance, venture capitalists investing in biotechnology or nanotechnology firms often expect the firms’ leaders to maintain a business focus while also staying at the cutting edge of science. But bridging science and business logics is extremely difficult—as shown by the high failure rate of science-based startups. Lounsbury is at the forefront of research in sociology and organization theory—that is, the study of how organizations are structured and managed, relate to their environments, and cope with change. He and his research team are addressing an important blind spot in the study of entrepreneurship: the processes that create entrepreneurial opportunities and influence entrepreneurial success. Lounsbury’s research will encompass nanotechnology, eco-entrepreneurship, financial markets and social innovation. As Canada strives to become more globally competitive, this research will have important practical and policy implications for creating and sustaining economic and social prosperity in the future. "

They play a key role in many disease processes by protecting the bacteria, making them more capable of thriving and causing illness. These dense sugars fortify the bacteria cells’ defences and help them to communicate more effectively with their environments. A better understanding of these processes could lead to novel solutions to combat certain diseases, such as tuberculosis and leprosy. But these sugars are present in tiny quantities, making them challenging to study. Dr. Todd Lowary, Canada Research Chair in Carbohydrate Chemistry, gets around this problem by preparing synthetic compounds that mimic the sugars on cell walls, which allows scientists to study them. His hope is that a better understanding of how these sugars aid bacterial processes could lead to new ways to prevent and treat certain diseases. The aim is to gather insights into how carbohydrates assemble on the bacterial cell wall, and what drugs might be used to prevent this process, thereby disabling the bacteria. Focusing on tuberculosis and its close cousin, leprosy—as well as on food-borne infections caused by E. coli and campylobacters—Lowary's research will lead to exciting new knowledge and possibly new treatments, diagnostics and vaccines. Given that tuberculosis currently kills more than a million people annually (while the related disease in cattle represents a serious economic threat to agriculture), these advances will benefit Canadians as well as people around the world.

So it is no surprise that most molecules involved in drug therapies work by binding to a target protein and altering how it works. This puts proteins at the center of the $1 trillion global pharmaceutical industry. The function of each protein depends on its molecular structure: that is, the specific three-dimensional shape that each protein folds into. Dr. Justin MacCallum, Canada Research Chair in Biomolecular Structure and Design, uses a combination of laboratory experiments and computer simulation to better understand and manipulate protein structure. Learning the structure of a protein allows researchers to understand how it functions at the molecular level, and provides critical information needed to design drugs that target it. MacCallum and his research team are also focusing on protein design—creating new proteins that do not exist in nature. Because a protein’s structure and function are related, it is possible to manipulate a protein’s structure to ensure it has a desired function. MacCallum’s team is designing proteins that can bind tightly to specific target proteins, which have applications as therapeutics and molecular diagnostics. By focusing on understanding and designing protein structure, MacCallum’s research is furthering our understanding of the molecular details of biology, and laying the groundwork for the development of new drugs and therapeutic strategies.

The nanostructures that result from self-assembly can include nanotubes, micelles (lipid molecules), and vesicles (small structures within cells). Nanomaterials contain nanoparticles—smaller than 100 nanometres in at least one dimension—and are increasingly used in health care, electronics, cosmetics, and various technologies. These nanostructures are sensitive to their environments, meaning their geometries and shapes can be controlled by certain exterior factors, such as the pH level of the environment. This means they have considerable potential for use in drug-delivery systems. As Canada Research Chair in Self-assembly and Nanomaterials, Dr. Cecile Malardier-Jugroot aims to deepen her understanding of how polymers (larger molecules composed of many similar subunits bonded together) self-assemble under environmentally favourable conditions. Her research will help develop new avenues for synthesizing nanoreactors. Nanoreactors (which produce nanoparticles) are ideal for synthesizing water-based catalytic devices, and could potentially lead to ground-breaking applications in fuel cells, leading to more sustainable energy use.

The fuels in our cars, the medicines we take, and even the screens on our phones are products of the chemical industry—but making these materials comes with a price. Energy and costly raw materials are needed, and significant amounts of waste are often generated along with the end products. But it doesn’t have to be that way. By designing new chemical reactions that use renewable resources and generate minimal by-products, Dr. Stephen Newman, Canada Research Chair in Sustainable Catalysis, is working to ensure the Canadian chemical and pharmaceutical industries are sustainable, environmentally friendly, and profitable in the future. Newman and his research team accomplish these goals using catalysts: chemicals that make challenging reactions feasible by reducing the energy barrier. The human body uses complex enzymes to do similar work. In chemistry, researchers like Newman turn to metals like rhodium, palladium, and ruthenium. These catalysts are not consumed in catalytic reactions, so very small amounts can be used to make large amounts of product. Discovering new catalytic reactions and processes can be challenging and labour intensive. To enable his team to test and analyze hundreds of reactions every day, Newman makes use of modern tools and technologies, maximizing their chances of finding better ways to make valuable materials, pharmaceuticals, and polymers.

The answer is: often, far less than it would seem from the pixel count. This is because images follow certain regular patterns. In other words, they contain structure. This answer also begs another question: Can the essence of an image be captured with even fewer measurements? The field of compressed sensing—the focus of research by Dr. Yaniv Plan, Canada Research Chair in Data Science—addresses this question in a broader context. Plan is trying to find out how many measurements are needed to accurately capture a structured signal. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is one example of a process that benefits from his work, since reducing the number of measurements could shorten the procedure. A central question in Plan’s research is: How can you ensure image measurements are taken as economically as possible? Surprisingly, random measurements often provide a near-optimal answer. But you still need to understand how various signal structures behave in high dimensions and under random projections. And more challenges arise out of the need to invert the measurement process in a way that is computationally feasible. Plan’s research has produced a number of theoretical advances in compressed sensing and related fields. He is continuing to explore how we can make better use of signal structure in contexts ranging from quantum state tomography to teaching analytics.

Retrieved memories also help build new ones: key details from course prerequisites make it easier to learn new material. These examples show how the act of remembering can change us. Researchers’ ability to investigate the cognitive processes influenced by retrieving memories has been slowed by volunteers’ limited ability to accurately describe their own experience of doing so, and by the fact that their doing so intrinsically changes the retrieval dynamics being studied. But emerging functional neuroimaging technologies make it possible for researchers to covertly observe memories as they become active in the brain, making new insights possible.

As Canada Research Chair in Freshwater Ecology and Fisheries, Rennie is working with national and international partners to study the effects of pollution, climate change and invasive species on our freshwater ecosystems. By using a whole-ecosystem approach—and extensive long-term data sets from pristine lakes to help interpret their findings—Rennie and his collaborators can clearly show how lakes and the fish that live in them respond to environmental stresses. In particular, Rennie’s research focuses on how fish species respond to stress, and how their responses can affect population dynamics and entire ecosystems. Fish often move to other regions or are replaced by more tolerant species when climate change warms their lakes and rivers, or when they are affected by human activity. But fish may also respond to environmental change in more subtle behavioural ways—for example, spending more time searching for food, or delaying spawning. Even these subtle changes can have profound effects on their growth, reproduction and, ultimately, their population size. As their population size changes, so too will the ecosystem they occupy. By better understanding how fish respond to environmental stress, Rennie hopes to contribute to the establishment of a whole-ecosystem approach to fisheries management that will support economically and ecologically sustainable fisheries in the future.

However, the spatial resolution in optical microscopy is limited to about the size of a big virus. Although a virus is tiny enough to be invisible to the naked eye, this resolution is still about ten thousand times too coarse to allow scientists to observe molecular structure at its finest detail, down to its building blocks: atoms. To address this challenge, Dr. Germán Sciaini, Canada Research Chair in Atomically Resolved Dynamics and Ultrafast High-Resolution Imaging, is developing ultrafast electron cameras whose spatial and temporal resolutions make it possible for researchers to study molecular structure and dynamical phenomena at the atomic level. As recently as 50 years ago, changes in the structures of molecules were thought to be invisible and immeasurably fast. Today, thanks to research like Sciaini’s, scientists have access to the spatial and temporal resolutions they need to observe atoms in motion. This research has wide-ranging implications for scientists seeking to predict, explain, and understand phenomena that change over time in physics, chemistry, and biology. "

Each hand has 27 bones and each foot has 26—a trait we share with African apes. In the late 1800s, anatomist Thomas Henry Huxley used these facts and others like them to infer that humans were more closely related to African apes than to any other primate species. It took more than 100 years before genetic evidence confirmed Huxley's highly controversial—but astute— inference. Now, research is showing that there were once many species of humans (called hominins) that went extinct but are more closely related to modern humans than any living or fossil ape. As Canada Research Chair in Human Origins, Dr. Matt Tocheri wants to uncover important clues about the relationships among these extinct species of hominins. His analysis of the wrist bones from Homo floresienis—the so-called “hobbits” of human evolution—is widely considered one of the strongest pieces of evidence yet discovered that these extinct humans were a species distinct from our own. Through continuing excavations on the Indonesian island of Flores, Tocheri is investigating the timing and nature of the extinction of Homo floresiensis, the first modern humans on Flores, and their transition from a hunting-gathering society to a farming one. By providing a greater understanding of past human diversity, both biologically and culturally, this research may help us make informed decisions about the future of our species and the world we inhabit.

Many argue its roots stem from cultural changes in the 19th and 20th centuries, but Dr. Laurent Turcot, Canada Research Chair in the History of Leisure and Entertainment, believes we need to look further back in time. To understand the origins of leisure and entertainment—e.g., the emerging popularity of activities like taking walks, hunting, or playing pool, cards, and board games, as well as the emergence of theatres, cafés, fairs, and gardens—Turcot argues we must look as far back as the 16th to 19th centuries. He and his research team are analyzing how entertainment became both diversified and specialized during this period. Their aim is to determine the foundations of modern, leisure-based, urban culture in continental Europe, the Atlantic coast of the United States, and Lower Canada (now Quebec and parts of Atlantic Canada). Using a range of different sources, such as engravings, paintings, travel guides, books, police reports, architectural plans, and municipal decisions, Turcot is trying to shed light on how leisure and entertainment shape citizens’ identities and define group and individual behaviour.

Yet every year, Canada experiences outbreaks of communicable diseases. Often, their origins and transmission remain a mystery. Until now. As Canada Research Chair in Public Health Genomics, Dr. Jennifer Gardy is using genomic epidemiology to better understand how communicable diseases move from person to person. Genomic epidemiology involves sequencing the entire genome—the complete set of genetic instructions—of all bacterial or viral pathogens from a specific outbreak. Using this information, Gardy and her research team can identify single-letter changes that arise in one sick patient and are passed to anyone they infect. By examining several such changes in an outbreak, Gardy’s team can pinpoint exactly how the disease moved from person to person-—information that is key to stopping the outbreak and preventing future ones. Not only does a genome contain information about how a pathogen spreads, but it can also be used to diagnose specific infections, predict how powerful the pathogen might be, and quickly identify its weak points or ability to resist different treatments. By revolutionizing our ability to understand and manage outbreaks, Gardy’s research could fundamentally change public health microbiology practices in Canada and around the world. "

Meanwhile, only a small fraction of the drug typically reaches the affected region. A better approach would treat the cancer more effectively without harming other parts of the body. For this to happen, drugs would need to be able to travel through blood vessels using the most direct route from the injection site to the treatment area. Dr. Sylvain Martel, Canada Research Chair in Medical Nanorobotics, aims to develop new medical platforms, maneuverable drugs and other treatments that will make this possible. Martel is combining nanotechnology (the manipulation of matter on an atomic, molecular, and supramolecular scale) and principles of robotics to develop treatment methods that can deliver drugs more deeply and directly to solid tumors and hard-to-treat areas. To accomplish this, Martel and his research team are working on several approaches. One is the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to develop complementary ways of delivering drugs to blood vessels. Another uses special computer-controlled flagellated bacteria (bacteria that have lash-like appendages to propel themselves). Carrying treatments, these micro-organisms can be guided towards solid tumors using specially developed platforms that harness their behaviors and onboard sensors to force them to deliver their cargo to the affected areas.

Skeletal muscle stem cells, which have a strong capacity to regenerate and repair damage, are especially useful for studying how this works. But during the aging process, and with neuromuscular diseases such as muscular dystrophies, muscles’ ability to repair themselves is dramatically compromised. As Canada Research Chair in Stem Cells Epigenetics, Dr. Vahab Soleimani is looking to gain a better understanding of how stem cells renew and regenerate themselves by studying the mechanisms that control how stem cells function during skeletal muscle regeneration and repair. All cells in our body contain the same set of genes. Inside each cell, or tissue type, some genes are active while others are not, or are packaged in “non-active” forms. This “packaging” of the genome is regulated by epigenetic mechanisms. These epigenetic mechanisms also give stem cells their unique ability to renew themselves or to differentiate into different cell types during tissue repair. By studying these epigenetic mechanisms, Soleimani and his research team hope to further our understanding of how the activity of muscle stem cells is regulated. This research could lead to developing better treatments for patients suffering from muscle-wasting diseases. "

Thanks to the achievements of MRI science, researchers can make movies of a beating heart, map nerve fibre connections between regions of the brain, or visualize and measure blood flow, among many other applications. These processes begin with MRI scientists translating physics into software; the MRI scanner then translates the software into magnetic fields, and listens to how the atomic nuclei in the human body respond. Next, using advanced math and computational power, the scanner translates this response into images. Dr. Alexander Rauscher, Canada Research Chair in Developmental Neuroimaging, develops new MRI techniques to map the human brain and spinal cord quantitatively. He and his research team specialise in investigating the frequency of the magnetic resonance signal. Like a lighthouse beam, the MRI signal has both a brightness level and a direction. The brightness, or intensity, is used in conventional medical MRI scans, while the direction—which is related to the signal's frequency—is usually ignored. Rauscher is looking at how information about frequency can be turned into new ways of mapping the human brain. Such new tools will become markers of tissue damage and repair, ultimately helping with diagnosis, treatment monitoring, and outcome prediction. Eventually, Rauscher's work will lead to an improved ability to characterize and understand changes in the human brain caused by injury and disease. Earlier diagnosis and clearer, more effective separation of diseases into subtypes will make it easier for people to receive the right medical treatment at the right time. "

Careful study of sounds like these can reveal information about the mechanisms that generate them and the environments they travel through. Wind, rainfall, snowfall, ice formation, and melt generate noise in the ocean, and tell us about our earth’s climate and weather. For example, measuring surf noise on a beach can reveal how sound travels in water-saturated sand, and the noise on a coral reef tells us about the collective health of its inhabitants.

Acquiring information on past changes to our climate is also crucial for determining and simulating the past state of the Earth’s climate over decades and even centuries. As Canada Research Chair in Climate Dynamics, Beltrami will address the key challenges of characterizing the energy exchange between our atmosphere and the shallow part of the Earth’s continental crust—an interaction that is extremely important for life on our planet. Through theoretical and field-based projects, Beltrami and his interdisciplinary research team are trying to improve the land-surface model components (tools that represent energy and water flux exchanges between land and the atmosphere) of global climate models. Because the causes and impacts of climate change affect many disciplines, Beltrami’s research will touch on areas as varied as permafrost stability, soil biogeochemical processes, public health, and food security planning. It will also create dialogue between scientists, the public, and policy-makers for identifying more sustainable approaches to dealing with climate change. "

The Connection Between Cell Communication and Cancer," You Talking to Me? The Connection Between Cell Communication and Cancer Clear and effective communication between the cells that make up our bodies is essential for ensuring our bodies function as they should. When cells fail to send, receive, or correctly interpret each other’s signals—that is, when they fail to “talk” to one another accurately—health problems, such as cancer, can result. About one in eight Canadians will be diagnosed with breast or prostate cancer during their lifetimes. Together, these two cancers account for more than 25 per cent of new cancer cases each year. Dr. Nicolas Bisson, Canada Research Chair in Cancer Proteomics, is developing new prognostic tools to ensure cancer patients benefit from the treatments that are best suited to them. To achieve this, Bisson and his research team are looking into how cells communicate. The parts of cells that are responsible for signalling are called proteins. Usually, proteins function in groups, called networks. Bisson and his team are trying to identify how these protein networks are formed in normal cells, how they are different in cancer, and how they change when breast and prostate cancers progress and metastasize. This information will help better predict outcomes for individual cancer patients and recommend the most suitable treatment options for them. "

For example, more than 98% of care for patients with chronic diseases is delivered by the patients themselves in collaboration with professionals, family members and other caregivers. As a result, it is increasingly apparent that patients are “co-producers” of health—sharing in the leadership, design and delivery of the health care system. But while this sounds good in theory, moving from rhetoric to action is complex. To establish meaningful and effective partnerships between patients and health professionals, we face considerable barriers, including tokenism, power imbalances, institutional resistance to change and challenges in engaging with marginalized populations. Dr. Antoine Boivin, Canada Research Chair in Patient and Public Partnership, aims to strengthen the design, implementation, and scale-up of effective patient and public partnerships. He and his research team are testing the impacts of these partnerships on patient-reported outcomes; identifying the key components of effective partnership interventions; and exploring contextual factors that influence the effectiveness of these interventions—all with a focus on aging, end-of-life and community health. Ultimately, Boivin’s research program will help patients, health professionals, decision-makers and citizens work together more effectively to improve the health of our communities. "

Even so, the nature and meaning of communities driven by national identity in areas like South Asia, Africa and the Middle East are growing more important to know about as our world becomes more inter-connected. Learning how populations in these areas understand religion, secularism and political expression helps us understand how national identities fit into global processes. Key questions about the history of decolonization arise from conflicts and debates around religion in the public sphere. They also stem from the role of local languages, cultures and religions in post-colonial states, and from the role of migrant communities in post-imperial states. Dr. Neilesh Bose, Canada Research Chair in Global and Comparative History, is using oral, cultural and intellectual methods to explore the history of decolonization. For example, his research features an oral history of Bengali intellectuals who lived through India’s decolonization (1931 to 1947). Conducted together with researchers in the United States and Bangladesh, this work—the collective biography of a generation—looks at the relationships between private and public lives, self-expression, and the choices communities made against a backdrop of world transitions shaped by diverse forces. Bose’s broader research looks at the nature and place of religion, nationalism, and the role that colonized regions play in the modern world. Through this research, Bose and his team are providing a lens into how colonial and post-colonial regions contributed to debates that remain relevant to today’s globalized society. "

The genomic component remains a mystery even to most researchers, but Dr. Yohan Bossé, Canada Research Chair in Genomics of Heart and Lung Diseases, is working to unravel it—deciphering, sharing, and translating new genomic knowledge into clinical practices for heart and lung health. The risk of suffering from heart and lung diseases is not the same for everyone: genetics plays a determining role. Bossé and his research team are using modern genomic approaches—such as whole-genome DNA genotyping and sequencing—to understand the molecular basis of these diseases as well as the differences in how individuals respond to treatments and environmental exposures. Bossé’s research focuses on two themes: the genomics of the most common and debilitating respiratory diseases, including asthma and smoking-related lung diseases (especially lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease); and the genetics of life-threatening aortic valve diseases, for which no medical treatment is currently available. Bossé and his team are developing innovative projects to fill the gaps in the diagnosis and treatment of these diseases using large collections of unique biological samples. They are heavily involved in research collaboration, and are committed to contributing their expertise to national and international research groups that study heart and lung diseases.

Home to Earth and our solar system, the Milky Way Galaxy has been studied for a century, yet little is known about its most basic properties—its mass, scale, chemical structure, and the number and kinds of stars it contains. Over the next few years, data on the Milky Way will be arriving at a rate we’ve never seen before. Large-scale surveys of the sky—such as the Gaia project’s catalogue of one billion stars—will reward scientists with a wealth of information. But to use this information, they will need the right tools to unlock it—and current modeling tools are not up to the task. As Canada Research Chair in Galactic Astrophysics, Dr. Jo Bovy is developing and applying rigorous modelling and statistical tools to help us better understand Earth’s place in the universe. In addition to publishing his findings in traditional outlets, such as scientific journals, he is also making his techniques and results freely available as open-source software. This, in turn, will accelerate the rate of scientific progress. Along with teaching us about the history and nature of our home galaxy, Bovy’s work will help us better understand how galaxies form, and will advance knowledge in other areas of astrophysics "

They are now omnipresent in our daily lives thanks to the extraordinary properties that result from their tiny sizes. Just as nature unites proteins, enzymes and other nano-entities to create organs, Dr. Nadi Braidy, Canada Research Chair in Multifunctional Nanomaterials, assembles nanomaterials to make use of their different properties simultaneously. When united this way, nanomaterials not only retain their individual properties—they develop additional ones. The catalytic converter (a component of the exhaust system in internal combustion engines) is an excellent example. It is an assembly of various nanostructures, with each one helping to reduce emissions. Meanwhile, other nanomaterials help stabilize the structures and complete the process of catalysis. Although it is possible to create complex nanomaterials from different components, they must be able to adapt to be useful in an industrial context. Moreover, to design successful production methods, we must be able to observe how the multifunctional components are positioned at the atomic scale. This is one of the aspects of Braidy’s research. Braidy and his research team are also developing ways to synthesize hybrid nanomaterials for large-scale applications. They hope to develop innovative methods of observing and understanding nanostructures at the nanometric scale. The materials they produce may spur innovation in many fields—from the transformation of toxic gases to the bio-filtration of wastewater to the development of new materials for turbine blades. "

This leaves us with large gaps in what we know about the organizational features of how the sex industry works and the varied experiences of those involved. Dr. Victoria Bungay, Canada Research Chair in Gender, Equity and Community Engagement, is looking at the diversity of the sex work industry and people’s everyday experiences within it. She asks male, female and transgender sex workers, their clients and those who work in other aspects of the industry (such as security, booking or advertising) about how they engage with one another. She studies the extent to which social, economic and legal policies and practices affect these relationships. Her research also examines how the social aspects and structure of the sex industry affect the safety and overall quality of life for sex workers. Bungay’s research is part of a larger research agenda to understand how gender and sexuality are viewed and valued in society, and how the commercialization of sexual activities can resist or support discriminatory attitudes about sexual relationships. This research will fill gaps in understanding about the sex work industry and the diverse needs of those involved.

Developed economies’ share of world GDP, which was over 80 percent in 1990, is expected to shrink to about 50 percent by 2018. This change is almost entirely due to the rise of emerging market economies—those with low to middle per capita income that are growing quickly, usually due to economic developments and reforms. This shift in global consumption—from developed to developing economies—coincides with the rise of multinational corporations in developing economies. While they made up only 4 per cent of the Fortune Global 500 firms in 1995, they now comprise more than a quarter of the list.

The presence of more than seven billion humans on Earth is profoundly altering our global ecosystems. Worldwide, thousands of species are in decline. Yet invasive species are spreading rapidly to new areas, where they thrive at the expense of native species. They may also disrupt ecosystem services—such as crop pollination, food and water production, or disease control—that are important for human health and welfare. How do invasive species thrive when so many others are failing? That is the question Dr. Robert Colautti, Canada Research Chair in Rapid Evolution, is trying to answer. He is identifying the genetic changes that occur swiftly in invasive species, allowing them to thrive in new environments. In particular, Colautti is searching for evolutionary and genetic explanations for why two of Canada’s most invasive weeds—purple loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria) and garlic mustard (Alliaria petiolata)—have achieved ecological dominance. Researchers in the Colautti lab are combining field experiments with cutting-edge methods in statistical quantitative genetics and next-generation sequencing to investigate the genetic reasons for why some species become dominant in new and changing environments. This research could lead to substantially improved techniques for monitoring and managing invasive species; greater yields of biological resources (e.g., crops, forests); and better ways to curb biodiversity losses in a rapidly changing world.

These at-risk languages are mainly spoken in socially and politically marginalized communities, such as many of Canada's Indigenous communities. When a language disappears, it represents a loss of cultural wealth and community identity—but it also means a piece of the puzzle at the heart of scientific linguistic inquiry is lost. It makes it more challenging for researchers to discover and understand the principles and parameters of the uniquely human capacity for language. Dr. Jessica Coon, Canada Research Chair in Syntax and Indigenous Languages, is studying this capacity through collaborative research with academics and linguistic communities. More specifically, she and her research team are investigating the rich and complex systems of verbal inflection in languages of the Mayan family in Mexico and Guatemala, and in Algonquian languages of Canada. In both of these language families, verbs may be highly complex, expressing information that would require a whole sentence—or multiple sentences—in languages like English or French. Coon’s research seeks to understand the underlying mechanisms behind these grammatical systems, and use this knowledge to test existing linguistic theories. By engaging community members directly in her language documentation and linguistic research, Coon’s work will lead to a better understanding of the grammars of these languages and the study of language in general. She also hopes it will help promote and support efforts to revitalize at-risk languages in Canada and around the world. "

A notable example is the Ebola virus, which causes highly lethal hemorrhagic fevers in humans. Other emerging threats include the Marburg virus, Lassa fever virus, and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus. All of these cause severe disease in humans—and there are currently no approved vaccines or effective therapies to combat them. But to develop new therapeutic drugs and, potentially, broad-spectrum antivirals, researchers need a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which viruses infect cells. In particular, we need to identify the cellular proteins that viruses need and use during the infection process, because these can be targeted to block the spread of viruses.

It is expected that by 2030, 23.3 million people will die from heart disease and stroke every year. As Canada Research Chair in Arterial Wall Biology and Atherogenesis, Dr. Myron Cybulsky is studying atherosclerosis, the accumulation of plaques within the arterial wall, in the hopes of finding ways to help decrease these numbers. As plaque accumulates within the arterial wall, it narrows and hardens the arteries, which in turn hinders blood flow. These arterial plaques can rupture, allowing blood to clot inside an artery and potentially cause a stroke or heart attack. Although many risk factors for atherosclerosis and associated heart disease have already been identified, how these harmful plaques are formed is not yet fully understood. Cybulsky will build on his 20 years of research to get to the root of what ignites this often deadly chain of events. Specifically, he will investigate the communication between endothelial cells that line the inner surface of arteries and white blood cells that reside in the inner layer of the normal artery. He will also determine how this communication is altered in the early stages of atherosclerosis. Cybulsky hopes that by offering a better understanding of how and why these plaques form, his research will help doctors to treat heart disease before it becomes fatal. "

Time spent in school certainly equalizes children’s exposure to learning resources and opportunities. But Dr. Scott Davies, Canada Research Chair in Data, Equity and Policy in Education, has found that aspects of children’s lives outside of school—such as their socioeconomic status—give them widely varying exposures to learning opportunities and resources, particularly during the summer months. This discrepancy can leave some children at a distinct disadvantage compared with their peers, despite their equal access to resources during the school year. Davies plans to untangle the effects of schools on learning from the effects of other influences. He will follow children’s achievements from their early preschool years into their secondary years to collect data that will help answer several core research questions: Do early abilities predict secondary achievement? What are typical student trajectories—and are they affected by disability, language, immigration, gender, Aboriginal status, or other social categories? Collecting and organizing this data will be invaluable in establishing a baseline that Davies and his research team can use to assess whether early interventions—such as summer programs aimed at reducing the achievement gap—can alter students’ typical trajectories. Ultimately, Davies’ research may influence policy in educational equity. "

As Canada Research Chair in Human Factors and Transportation, Dr. Birsen Donmez is studying in-vehicle technologies—such as smart phones, in-car warning systems, and wearable devices—to understand their impact on driver distraction and their potential to improve road safety. Donmez is trying to determine whether technologies that alert drivers to risky driving behaviours, or notify them of upcoming roadway events, can improve drivers’ response times and driving behaviours. Dashboard-mounted displays have already been shown to benefit drivers when they provide information that is related to driving. For example, drivers are more likely to comply with speed limits when their cars display them. Donmez and her research team have also found that devices that provide feedback regarding driver distraction, such as real-time warnings, can direct drivers’ attention away from a secondary task and back to the road. By investigating the influence of traditional and emerging in-vehicle technologies on driver distraction, Donmez and her team hope to develop concrete tools to improve road safety. "

Few Canadian provinces can estimate how many children they place in out-of-home care over time, let alone whether these children make developmental progress. This makes it difficult to properly evaluate or develop services that will benefit them. Dr. Tonino Esposito has created one of Canada’s largest, most comprehensive longitudinal child protection data sets. As Canada Research Chair in Social Services for Vulnerable Children, he plans to study how out-of-home placements affect children’s well-being. He will also study how socioeconomic vulnerabilities affect child protection service outcomes, as well as the long-term impact of policy and service innovations that aim to address these difficulties. To conduct these studies, Esposito and his research team will merge clinical child protection data with youth criminal justice data and Census data to examine how out-of-home placements can influence youth criminality, behavioural problems and academic success. They will also study the extent to which disparities in socioeconomic vulnerabilities and health and social service funding affect the likelihood of out-of-home placement, family reunification (and reunification breakdown), and recurring child abuse. Ultimately, Esposito’s work will help policymakers better understand the context and challenges that vulnerable children and families face. This has the potential to change the way we prioritize social services and transform policy on these issues. "

But traditional modes of transportation are in crisis due to their heavy reliance on fossil fuels. The evolution of the transportation sector is increasingly being questioned for its impact on climate change, public health and traffic congestion in urban areas. In 2015 in Québec, road transport was responsible for about 40% of greenhouse gas emissions and 75% of total oil consumption. Electric vehicles (hybrids, plug-in hybrids, fuel cell vehicles and fully electric vehicles) present both a challenge and a solution to these issues. Dr. João Trovão, Canada Research Chair in Efficient Electric Vehicles with Hybridized Energy Storage Systems, is developing energy systems and highly efficient propulsion systems that will make electric vehicles more efficient and give them a greater driving range than what is currently available. Trovao’s research focuses on range as well as battery aging and recharging time. He hopes to improve performance by using hybridized energy storage systems and reducing energy loss. His innovations will be made widely available to major industry leaders through technology transfer. Trovao’s research will contribute to the development of a new generation of more efficient electric vehicles. Better suited to the needs of consumers, these vehicles will offer a more attractive alternative to traditional vehicles and support the larger goal of sustainable development. "

Yet there are still great mysteries about the cosmos that elude us. For example, we don’t know what happened after the Big Bang—how the universe evolved, what it is made of, or how it continues to change. Dr. Bryan Gaensler, Canada Research Chair in Radio Astronomy, is searching for answers to questions like these. Much of his effort has been devoted to developing and planning the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), which—when completed in twin locations in South Africa and Australia—will be the largest radio telescope ever built, and will help answer questions about the very early universe and how it evolved into the cosmos we know today. Optical telescopes, such as the Hubble, produce stunning visual images of stars and galaxies. Radio telescopes are used to explore the hidden universe by detecting radio waves from violent and extreme objects, such as supermassive black holes. In providing this alternative view of the universe, radio telescopes can detect invisible gases and reveal areas of space that may be obscured by cosmic dust. Gaensler and his research team will use radio signals from space to study how magnetism in the universe has evolved and to carry out a novel census of the changing sky. The aim of this research is to make new discoveries about the universe and design the experiments planned for the SKA—a multibillion-dollar project that promises enormous scientific, economic, and engineering opportunities for Canada.

We need to consider the role that cinema will play in the 21st century. Dr. André Gaudreault, Canada Research Chair in Film and Media Studies, is questioning the role that technological innovation plays in the evolution of cinematic forms and practices by studying two watershed moments in history: the arrival of cinema at the turn of the 20th century and, 100 years later, the digital explosion in the media landscape. He describes his method of investigation as “media archeology.” The originality of Gaudreault’s research is in evaluating change in the context of a continuum that stretches back to cinema’s earliest days. By observing today’s media landscape in light of the numerous changes that have marked the history of the medium, he is uncovering various aspects of the digital shift and broadening our understanding of cinema as a technological art form. Digital technology does not forecast the end of cinema, but it does force us to re-evaluate our ideas about its nature and to question its current state. Ultimately, this research will lay the foundation for a methodology that will be critical to our ability to understand how the cinema may be shaped in the future. "

For example, during Canada’s agricultural economy (from the 1700s to 1900s), there were large families dotted across the country. But when the country turned to manufacturing throughout the 1900s, fertility rates dropped by more than half and many Canadian cities tripled in size. Now, Canada is experiencing its third period of industrial change. Some 400,000 manufacturing jobs have disappeared since 2002—mostly in southern Ontario, home to nearly a third of Canadians. At the same time, many jobs have been created in the natural resource sector, often far away from large cities. Dr. Michael Haan, Canada Research Chair in Migration and Ethnic Relations, is exploring how this economic shift is influencing where Canadians choose to live. He and his research team are using large data files from provincial and federal government departments to study how people respond to industrial change. Do they move when their plant closes? If not, how do they make a living? Do they rely on employment insurance and social assistance? How do immigrants respond to industrial restructuring? And are there policies we can enact to smooth the transition towards Canada’s new economic and demographic realities? The answers Haan and his research team discover will inform debates on a wide range of topics, such as employment insurance, labour market development, immigration and, more generally, the changing role of governments and citizens in a post-industrial welfare state.

This produces approximately 1.9 gigatons of carbon dioxide each year—that’s equal to roughly 70 per cent of the combined CO2 produced by the world’s light passenger vehicles. Driven by mass urbanization in the developing world, global demand for lighting is expected to rise by 80 per cent by 2030. This will produce 3 gigatons of carbon dioxide annually, unless the design and implementation of efficient, low-cost lighting technologies improves substantially. The University of British Columbia’s Dr. Zachary Hudson, Canada Research Chair in Sustainable Chemistry, aims to address this challenge. Dr. Hudson’s lab seeks to develop new materials for solid-state lighting technologies, in order to improve efficiency while reducing manufacturing costs. Solid-state lighting based on organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) is one such promising technology. OLEDs are lightweight, flexible and can be significantly more efficient than traditional incandescent or fluorescent bulbs, but manufacturing large-area OLEDs displays and lighting panels remains prohibitively expensive. Dr. Hudson and his team are working on designing electronic materials that can be processed by low-cost technologies such as inkjet printing.

As humans, we learn continuously, from the time we take our first breath until we take our last. We learn about rewarding events, like what constitutes a good bottle of wine and where to get it, and about unpleasant events and how to avoid them. And we learn seemingly ordinary bits of information, like the colour of our neighbour’s door. Often, in our ever-changing environment, information we have learned in the past can become irrelevant. But to adapt to new situations, we must keep learning. The question is: How does that happen? It turns out that the more unexpected or surprising an event is, the more easily we learn about it. Dr. Mihaela Iordanova, Canada Research Chair in Behavioral Neuroscience, is trying to understand how the brain processes surprising events in all three of the above situations—that is, in rewarding, unpleasant, and seemingly inconsequential settings (known in neuroscience as appetitive, aversive and neutral settings, respectively). Iordanova and her research team use a variety of cutting-edge scientific techniques in conjunction with theoretically driven behaviour designs to uncover which brain circuits process this information. They are figuring out how neurons in the brain process information in real-time, as well as whether subsets of neurons are critical to specific aspects of learning. Iordanova’s research will provide insights into how appetitive, aversive and emotionally neutral processes can go awry in the presence of certain mental health disorders, such as anxiety, addiction or memory dysfunction, and may serve as a springboard to developing better treatments.

Organic electronics use polymers or small carbon-based molecule semiconductors instead of traditional silicon-based semiconductors. This adds flexibility and reduces manufacturing costs. As Canada Research Chair in Advanced Polymer Materials and Organic Electronics, Dr. Benoit Lessard is looking at another growing application of organic electronics: highly specific sensors. These wearable sensors can detect key physiological data (such as core temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, etc.), store data, and even administer drugs. For example, inexpensive toxic gas sensors could improve chemical processing and safety at chemical plants; highly specific sensors with ultra-fast response times could be used to detect drinking water contamination on-site, or to test athletes for the use of performance-enhancing drugs; and pressure-sensitive sensors could even give robots and burn victims the sense of touch. Lessard and his research team will focus on the use of “smart” polymers (which can respond to stimuli) in organic electronics sensors, and study how the environment affects the resulting devices. They hope to produce bendable, highly specific, organic electronic sensors that could be used for things such as environmental monitoring, better efficiency in chemical plants, and novel healthcare systems to improve quality of life.

As Canada Research Chair in Supramolecular Materials, Dr. Mark MacLachlan is looking to nature for inspiration to design and build new materials that may lead to transformative technologies. MacLachlan uses a supramolecular (meaning having an organization more complex than that of a single molecule) approach to assemble molecules and materials into complex structures. For instance, he uses cellulose nanocrystals—nanomaterials obtained from paper or cotton that are smaller than one-thousandth the width of a human hair—as building blocks. Using these nanocrystals as a template, MacLachlan and his research team have constructed glass films with spiral-shaped (helical) tunnels. The arrangement of these tunnels in the glass makes them iridescent, allowing the color of the reflected light to be tuned across the spectrum. These materials accurately mimic the intricate structures of many crab shells and iridescent beetle wings. MacLachlan and his team are exploring the use of cellulose nanocrystals and chitin nanocrystals from waste crab shells to construct new porous materials. (Chitin refers to the tough, semi-transparent substance that makes up the exoskeletons of certain insects and crustaceans.)

Although environmental justice only recently gained traction as a field of study, the concept is not new to Indigenous peoples, who already have highly developed ideas of justice that extend well beyond the commonly accepted views of peoples’ relationships to the environment. Merely incorporating Indigenous perspectives into existing environmental justice frameworks is not enough. As Canada Research Chair in Indigenous Environmental Justice, McGregor will carefully document Indigenous understandings of environmental justice as they extend from Indigenous ideas about governance, law and practices.

On top of that, these factors act upon intricately organized biological systems that have diverse components and interactions. As a result, designing effective treatments for these diseases requires untangling these risk factors to better understand their cascading effects. Dr. Sara Mostafavi, Canada Research Chair in Computational Biology, aims to develop computational models that capture the complexity of these biological systems and separate the factors that cause disease from those that are simply associated with it. Mostafavi and her research team are developing models that statistically integrate diverse types of biological data. Using high-throughput sequencing (a fast way to sequence and analyze large genomes), they are measuring the different parts of biological systems at various resolutions, such as at the genome, epigenome and transcriptome levels. Capturing several views of biological systems allows Mostafavi and her team to develop precise models that link the genomic sequence of biological systems to cellular phenotypes that govern cell and tissue behaviour. It also helps them disentangle the various factors that underlie a given disease.

Dr. Jean-Marc Narbonne aims to prove that the tradition of critical thinking that is so much a part of our contemporary Western culture was inherited from Ancient Greece. As Canada Research Chair in the Critical Spirit in Antiquity and the Emergence of Modernity, Narbonne wants to shed light on the tangible links between our ancient and modern cultures to help us understand how our contemporary society developed. The ideal of social dialogue, the value of examining different positions, and the search for the best possible compromise between different opinions are all cultural traits we inherited directly from Greco–Roman rationalism. The principle of tolerance—descended from the Greek ideas of frank speech (parrhèsia) and democratic freedom—presupposes our recognition that there are different possible viewpoints on any given topic and the need to find the most widely shared common denominator for them using reasoned arguments. The culture of competing ideas and common deliberation to reach the best compromise also comes from ancient Greek traditions, and should be reclaimed and reinforced today for our personal and common good. Seen from the perspective of the Greek heritage of critical thought, the evolution of contemporary society and the development of the beliefs and values we now witness seem both normal and positive. The critical spirit, also inherited from the Greeks, leads us to re-evaluate traditional perspectives, and explains the open, dynamic, tolerant character of our own culture. "

New methods of generating and analyzing biological data have helped scientists discover highly evolved biological processes that contribute to our genetic characteristics. But a multidisciplinary approach is needed to understand these complex processes. The models used to analyse genome sequences (which are based on the structures of the sequences) offer a different perspective than the more traditional approaches (which are based on the sequences themselves). Dr. Aïda Ouangraoua, Canada Research Chair in Biological and Computational Complexity, is developing models and algorithms that allow biological sequences to be compared and classified while their architectural complexities are tracked. These new computational models and tools will take into account different processes (such as the folding structures of non-coding ribonucleic acids, the transcription and alternative splicing of genes, and the structure of genes in the genome sequence) that are now the subject of intensive biological research because of the major role they play in the architecture of genome sequences. The underlying algorithms used by Ouangraoua and her research team will be based on techniques that compare and classify sequences and graphs. By shedding light on the factors involved in gene architecture and dysfunction, Ouangraoua’s research will help us to better understand how the evolution and variability of species and individuals are regulated at the genetic level. Ultimately, her research may also lead to more effective ways to treat certain genetic diseases. "

These waters provide important habitats for fish species that have commercial, recreational, and cultural value. Atlantic Canada, in particular, has a wealth of marine and freshwater systems that support fisheries. As Canada Research Chair in Aquatic Molecular Ecology and Ecological Genomics, Dr. Scott Pavey is using state-of-the-art technologies and techniques to explore how to conserve and manage these fish populations and make our fisheries more sustainable. By using the latest sequencing technology to study entire genomes of fish species, Pavey is able to characterize all genes in a species, such as the quantity, their location in the genome, and what type of regulatory DNA is nearby. Once he and his research team have collected this data, they will be able to screen the genomes in groups to assess genetic diversity and determine how the genes work together to create each fish’s traits, such as its size or colour, compared with fish from another river. Pavey hopes his research will determine the key genes responsible for the traits that are needed for adaptation and are important to recreational or commercial fishers, aquaculture workers, and people concerned about fish conservation. Ultimately, his findings will help prioritize efforts to protect the most important populations of fish species, and will make aquaculture more sustainable by drawing the connection between genes and fish physiology.

",The Muscles of the Robotics Revolution ," The Muscles of the Robotics Revolution Imagine a robot that could play the piano, dance a waltz, or even run a marathon. The arrival of intelligent machines that can interact physically with human beings will lead to a technological revolution someday soon. But there is still a major hurdle: the creation of robotic “muscles” (actuators) that can perform as well as, or even better than, real biological muscles. Dr. Jean-Sébastien Plante, Canada Research Chair in Intelligent Fluid Actuators, has taken up the challenge. He and his research team are designing a new generation of actuators based on intelligent fluids known as magnetorheological fluids (MFs). These MFs are composed of oil containing very fine magnetic particles. When exposed to a magnetic field, this particle-charged fluid thickens. Using a single source of rotary power, gears use the MFs to generate power, which is then transmitted to the robot’s extremities. Compared with existing technologies, such as hydraulics and electric motors, MFs allow the creation of lighter, faster, more reliable robotic systems Plante and his team are focusing on identifying the failure modes and life cycles of MF actuators. They also hope to define the characteristics that would allow robots to make the best use of intelligent fluids. Intelligent fluid actuators offer better performance at costs that are comparable to existing technologies. Plante’s research could revolutionize robotics by making numerous robotics applications technologically and economically viable in applications ranging from aeronautics to medicine, transportation, and household use.

They also provide a framework to study transportation, communication or even social networks. Graph theory studies the ways in which sets of points—called vertices—can be connected by lines or arcs, called edges. Graph theory is not only fundamental to mathematics, but also to many branches of science and the humanities. With the ever-increasing inter-relatedness of our world, it will only become more important. As Canada Research Chair in Graph Theory, Dr. Luke Postle is tackling some of the most fundamental problems in graph theory. In particular, he is studying graph coloring (where colors are assigned to vertices or nodes of the graph to satisfy certain properties). Postle and his team are looking at the relationship between the ratio of edges to vertices in a graph and the minimum number of colors needed to color it. Their goal is to develop new tools and techniques that will improve our understanding of graphs, especially with regards to algorithmic applications for computer science. By studying the interconnections between graphs, colorings, nowhere-zero flows (a special type of network flow which is related to coloring planar graphs), probability and topology, Postle and his team aim to develop new algorithmic and computational tools.

But for thousands, even the simple act of lifting a cup of coffee or using a spoon to eat is a challenge. For countless others, impaired movement makes it impossible to take part in their favorite hobby or even work. Dr. Andrew Pruszynski, Canada Research Chair in Sensorimotor Neuroscience, aims to improve the lives of people with motor dysfunction. He believes that understanding movement—and helping those who suffer from impairment—requires an appreciation of the intimate relationship between the nervous system and the body it controls. Pruszynski and his research team are using a unique combination of skills—in robotics and neuroscience—to dissect the basic neural circuitry that underlies both healthy and impaired movement. They are studying how various parts of the nervous system—from receptors in the skin and muscles to neurons in the brainstem and cerebral cortex—coordinate to create skilled movement of the arm and hand. They are also investigating how this coordination fails when parts of the nervous system or body are damaged. Pruszynski’s work has already shed light on how sensory input from the skin and muscles influences motor areas of the cerebral cortex. He has also discovered that neurons in the skin perform calculations previously believed to occur only in the brain—a process that may be critical for dexterity. Ultimately, Pruszynski’s findings could lead to a whole new generation of rehabilitation tools and regimes that will improve the lives of people with motor dysfunction. "

The “biomarkers” of aging lay deep within our cells, and respond to both the healthy lifestyle choices we make and to the major stressors we face. While the negative effects of adversity on these biomarkers have been widely studied, less is known about what protects people from these effects. Dr. Eli Puterman, Canada Research Chair in Physical Activity and Health, believes physical activity may be part of the formula. Puterman studies how adverse experiences from childhood to older adulthood can speed up the aging of our immune systems. His research shows that physical activity may delay immune aging in people who have experienced significant adversity. His research has repeatedly shown that the impact of adversity on aging and disease is stronger in those who are less physically active, and greatly reduced or eliminated in those who are more active. Puterman’s research aims to deepen our understanding of how physical activity can make highly stressed people more resilient. By figuring out who can benefit psychologically and biologically from physical activity—and how—he and his research team may be able to develop strategies to help people living with adversity before they develop disease. Puterman’s research will make the most of our ability to improve the health of Canadians of all ages who are at greatest risk of accelerated immune system aging and disease. "

But chronic career indecision can lead to higher dropout rates and keep youth from completing postsecondary education. This is cause for concern, especially considering the number of baby boomers now retiring and the increased need for an educated, specialized workforce. Since students who drop out due to career indecision don’t necessarily experience academic difficulties, it is important to identify the underlying reasons why this happens. As Canada Research Chair in Parenting and Academic and Vocational Trajectories, Dr. Catherine Ratelle is examining how parents can better support their children to create and pursue concrete career plans. Targeting elementary to university students and their parents, Ratelle and her research team are using longitudinal studies, observational studies, and intervention research to examine parents’ ability to support their children’s psychological needs. They will also look at individual, relational, and social factors that promote or hinder parents’ supportive behaviors, and how these factors shape students’ choices at key decision times, such as transitioning between schools and choosing a career. By better understanding how parents influence their children’s career paths, this research will provide important insights into students’ academic and vocational decision-making processes.

But cities are also home to another, less visible system of transport: the movement of goods, often called freight. Dr. Matthew Roorda is a world leader in modelling and analyzing the movement of goods in cities. As Canada Research Chair in Freight Transportation and Logistics, he aims to understand the decisions businesses make when it comes to shipping their products, as well as how they interact, including how they form supply chains and contract with one another for logistics services. These decisions and interactions all result in the movement of goods. Put another way, what businesses do leads to particular patterns and volumes of trucks on roads. Roorda and his research team are developing microsimulation models that mimic the behaviour of individual businesses at a level of detail never before achieved. The outcome of this research will be a policy analysis tool that can be used to assess the economic, social, and environmental impacts of policies that influence business operations and the movement of goods. Given the fact that all levels of government and businesses of all sizes make decisions that affect freight operations, the potential reach and impact of this tool is enormous. Ultimately, the goal of this research is to promote more efficient and sustainable movement of goods in cities, leading in turn to better quality of life for residents and a more prosperous, less wasteful economy.

These non-communicable diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, and respiratory conditions, are long-lasting and cannot be cured. As Canada Research Chair in Population Health Analytics, Dr. Laura Rosella wants to find new strategies to help prevent them. While health care policymakers recognize that preventing chronic disease is a priority, prevention efforts have had little impact. The connection between chronic disease prevention and a stronger, more sustainable health care system has not been quantified, nor is it clear how prevention can address the challenges posed by those who rely on the system heavily. Rosella believes it is necessary to identify how to better allocate and invest resources so they will benefit both individuals and the entire health care system. That is why she wants to develop a strategy that considers an entire population, as well as the social and environmental factors that influence health and health care use. Rosella also believes population data—and finding innovative ways to use those data—are the key to supporting the policy changes needed to respond to growing health care challenges. Using a variety of large population databases containing health, social, and cost information, Rosella and her research team will develop prediction tools that identify people at high risk for developing chronic diseases as well as those who are more likely to rely heavily on the health care system. Working closely with key policymakers, her research will lead to new approaches for tackling chronic diseases and reducing their burden on the health care system. Rosella will also study how best to address disparities in chronic disease risk to ensure the system is both sustainable and equitable. "

The cloud interweaves computing and communications, and this convergence is changing our lives—and our world. Our mobile phones use wireless links to access networks that can transport vast volumes of data to the cloud. Where high-performance optical communications links are available, cloud processing allows mobile phones to perform far beyond the capabilities of a small device. Faster, denser links will allow these mobile devices to achieve even more. As Canada Research Chair in Communications Systems Enabling the Cloud, Dr. Leslie Rusch will make use of advances in materials and devices to create innovative systems that are even faster, achieving up to 10 times the current capacity.

For example, due to aging or increased traffic, many bridges built in the fifties and sixties have deteriorated to the point of being functionally obsolete. Many components of Canada’s municipal infrastructure—including water, waste water, storm water, and road systems—are also in poor or very poor condition. As well, waterfront infrastructure in coastal regions is vulnerable to rising sea-levels, flooding, erosion, storm, and corrosion. Yet many waterfronts are considered important cultural landmarks that should be repaired and maintained properly. Dr. Pedram Sadeghian, Canada Research Chair in Sustainable Infrastructure, is exploring sustainable solutions that can be applied to different features of our infrastructure. He and his research team are using advanced materials and innovative structural systems (such as fibre-reinforced polymer composites) to rehabilitate existing infrastructure and build new infrastructure that will offer longer and better service along with less environmental impact.

Abnormal changes in the activities of these biomolecules are responsible for diseases ranging from cancer to heart disease to neurodegeneration. Current therapies often target abnormal biomolecular activities to restore healthy cell function. But the malfunctioning of these molecular machines occurs well before any outward signs or symptoms of disease—meaning that disease could be detected or treated much earlier if these subcellular biomolecules could be directly measured or modulated. As Canada Research Chair in Chemical Biology, Dr. Adam Shuhendler is using innovative chemistry to improve our ability to identify abnormal activity in biomolecules and prevent disease.

He and his team are also developing strategies to create meaningful interaction and intensify aesthetic experience by using collaborative, multi-sensory engagement that involves the whole body. They will share the resulting software products with digitally literate artists and “creative coders” to help exhibit, distribute and document new creative works of unprecedented complexity. Interactive virtual worlds and mixed realities will be increasingly important forms of creative content in the future. Entertainment and software industries are already investing heavily in these areas while acknowledging the need for new software and aesthetic practices. Wakefield’s research will help meet the demand for more immersive, dynamic and open-ended interactive experiences in the arts and entertainment sectors. "

Protein folding is the process by which proteins become the shapes they need to be to get their work done. Mistakes in this folding process happen naturally, and normally our bodies can dispose of misfolded proteins. However, in some people with genetic predispositions—and in others as they age—the body is unable to eliminate misfolded proteins, and becomes overwhelmed. A variety of diseases are considered protein “misfolding” disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s disease, and type 2 diabetes. Traditionally, treatments for these conditions have focused on managing symptoms to increase quality of life for patients. What is not possible yet is to actually halt the disease’s progress. As the Canada Research Chair in Drug Design for Protein Misfolding Disorders, Dr. Donald Weaver may be poised to change that. He is an international authority on clinical research on dementia and epilepsy, as well as computer-aided drug design and medicinal chemistry. He has designed and co-developed two drugs that have reached phase 3 human clinical trials, including one of the first Alzheimer’s drugs that actually attacks the disease. Weaver will continue this work, using computational drug discovery and molecular modelling to design new drugs to target and prevent protein misfolding, with a particular focus on Alzheimer’s disease. Since that disease alone affects 47 million people worldwide, and is expected to double every 20 years, the potential impact of new drugs to treat it is enormous. "

The advantage of these conductive organic materials is their ability to be processed from solution onto lightweight, flexible surfaces with wide areas. Essentially, they are conductive inks that can be printed in roll-to-roll fashion, much like the process used in newspaper printing. The materials’ ability to be handled this way makes these technologies efficient and cost-effective. But where organic materials really shine is in their potential to produce solar electricity. Dr. Gregory Welch, Canada Research Chair in Solar Energy Materials and Devices, is exploring ways to process and assemble well-defined organic materials, also known as “small molecules,” from solution states into solid films that can convert solar energy to electricity. The organic solar cell that Welch is working on is a potentially game-changing technology. These solar cells can be made flexible, roll-able, and ultra-lightweight, creating an energy conversion device that can easily be worn or transported. These cells can also be color-tuned and made semi-transparent, allowing the type and amount of transmitted light to be finely adjusted. Such features open up new applications for solar cells, especially solar (photovoltaic) windows. By creating new, ultra-low cost materials, understanding how small molecules assemble to trap sunlight and convert it to electricity, and optimizing photon-to-electron conversion efficiencies, Welch aims to make major improvements in the field of organic solar cells and ensure the rapid commercialization of this clean energy technology.

The range is limited by the battery pack’s charge/discharge cycles. Driving longer distances means charging the pack more often, which reduces battery life. As Canada Research Chair in Electric Energy Storage Systems for Transportation Electrification, Dr. Sheldon Williamson is searching for new ways to extend the range of EVs while reducing costs, and is also exploring new plugged and wireless charging methods. Williamson’s research focuses on smart on-board energy management of batteries. Proper management prevents individual cells from becoming overstressed. This provides a more cost-effective approach to manufacturing and driving EVs, and extends their driving range by as much as 300 per cent. A capacitor stores electrical energy temporarily in an electric field; an ultracapacitor is a high-capacity version that bridges the gap between conventional electrolytic capacitors and rechargeable batteries. Williamson and his research group are focusing on high-power ultracapacitor systems as well as energy and power storage for hybrid (battery–ultracapacitor) systems. Their work will help develop new storage systems for electric buses, trains, and trams, as well as e-mobility vehicles, such as e-bikes and golf carts. By discovering efficient ways to store electric energy and developing fast wireless charging solutions, Williamson’s research could expand the use of mass transit and make electric cars more marketable. It could also cut the infrastructure costs of electric mass transit by more than half, compared with current costs. Ultimately, Williamson’s research could make Canada a world leader in transportation electrification and e-mobility. "

Globally, at least 44 per cent of diabetes, 23 per cent of ischaemic heart disease, and seven to 41 per cent of certain cancers are attributable to being overweight or obese. And obesity has no socioeconomic boundaries: it is found around the world in countries of all income levels. Over the past decade, a startling phenomenon has become known to medical science: the immune system—which normally helps us to fight disease—can team up with obesity to play a major role in the development of obesity-related diseases. How this happens is the focus of research by Dr. Daniel Winer, Canada Research Chair in Immunometabolism. We know that when a person becomes obese, one of the major changes in the body is in the fat that connects internal organs: immune cells flock to these sites to help. But through a complex process, they instead create inflammation, which in turn leads to serious illnesses, such as insulin resistance (a precursor to diabetes), type 2 diabetes, and fatty liver disease. Winer, a pioneer of research in this area, specializes in a new field called immunometabolism. He is building on his previous work in identifying how immune cells orchestrate inflammation in obesity. He will use genetically engineered mice and human cohorts to study how immune cells induce inflammation in fat, liver, and bowel to cause insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. This research may ultimately lead to new, innovative treatments for inflammation in disease. "

More young people are pursuing higher levels of education, but to succeed in today’s labour market, they are increasingly expected to maintain, adapt, and improve their skill sets over their careers. As Canada Research Chair in Life Course Transitions in Northern and Rural Communities, Dr. David Zarifa is investigating how individuals in northern and rural areas acquire and maintain the skills they need to succeed in today’s knowledge-driven economy. Zarifa’s work has shown that some social groups experience difficulties navigating the education system, entering the workforce, and maintaining their skills over the course of their working lives. Now, he and his research team are exploring whether some groups among northern and rural communities are under-represented in certain jobs; if the range and type of available schools and programs in northern and rural regions influence postsecondary choices and career pathways; and what unique challenges these regions face in attracting and retaining an innovative and skilled workforce. Zarifa’s work will help guide Canadian youth and their families as they choose from a growing array of pathways within the post-secondary education system, enter the labour market, launch their careers, and pursue success in their chosen line of work.

But inside, even the simplest, tiniest cell is unbelievably complex, with thousands of molecules working together in various combinations. The idea of a single gene carrying out an independent function has given way to a more sophisticated understanding of the pathways and networks that control an organism’s observable characteristics. In other words, what makes you six feet tall is not a simple “tall” gene, but a complex combination of events involving relationships between hundreds of genes working together inside your cells. Researchers’ growing interest in these complex relationships is leading to bigger, faster, and more efficient experiments: a data explosion. Dr. Alan Moses, Canada Research Chair in Computational Biology, aims to put that data to work. Moses is developing computational and statistical techniques that will use biological data to understand how molecules create cells’ complex behaviours. While the human genome project took 13 years to sequence one person’s genome, scientists can now routinely sequence 100 people’s genomes in just a few weeks. Soon, complete genome sequences for every patient, and digital microscope images for thousands of molecules, will be available. That will be a lot of data—but data are only as useful as our ability to harness them. Moses and his research team plan to use biological data to help scientists identify which genetic mutations will lead to cellular malfunctions and, in turn, to disease.

In fact, 90 per cent of all trade moves by ships. But while the shipping industry helps fuel our economies, it also impacts our health and that of our oceans. Ships produce pollution and wastes—ballast waters containing exotic species, oily waters from engine rooms and cargo tanks, garbage, sewage, antifouling paint, etc.—that are harmful to the environment. They can also injure marine mammals and spill their fuel and cargo by accident, putting coastal communities at risk. Ships’ smokestack emissions contribute to climate change and negatively impact human health. Sustainable shipping and safe, timely delivery of cargo rely on rules being uniform. But despite international agreements, this uniformity doesn’t always exist. As Canada Research Chair in Maritime Law and Policy, Dr. Aldo Chircop is studying jurisdictional and regulatory tools for navigation and shipping with the aim of promoting uniform rules that will protect our health and environment. Chircop is looking at the factors that facilitate and constrain uniform international shipping standards and their enforcement. He is also examining how Canadian maritime law can be developed further and harmonized with international rules.

In order to resolve this problem we need to develop improved feeding systems that maintain good levels of feed conversion yet are consistent with environmental, ethical and food safety objectives. Feeding regimes need to be environmentally and economically sustainable while meeting the needs of the livestock. Dr. James France, an agricultural policy and development expert, is devoting part of his time as the Canada Research Chair in Biomathematics in Animal Nutrition to assisting in the development of sustainable livestock management systems which produce meat and milk that meet the high standards demanded by those concerned with animal welfare, human health and the environment-and that are still economically acceptable to the farmer. Dr. France is doing this by improving our understanding of how farm animals utilize the nutrients in their feed and of how the mechanisms governing the kinetics and energetics of nutrient partitioning by these animals work. To do this, he needs to quantitatively analyse knowledge obtained from the ground up: from the level of the molecule, the cell and the tissue to the whole animal and the farm system. The right methods for such analysis are the methods of Newtonian dynamics, which have evolved over centuries for the study of kinetics and energetics. This basic nutritional knowledge has the potential of improving the efficiency with which animals utilize the nutrients in their feed. Improved efficiency translates into less pollution, lower costs and better animal care while at the same time producing high-quality meat and milk. "

In Canada, we have several populated areas that are prone to earthquakes and the structures located in these regions must be designed and built to withstand the effects of strong seismic ground motions.Dr. Robert Tremblay is devoting part of his time as a Canada Research Chair to examining the responses of different building systems to different types of seismic ground motions that may occur in various parts of the country. He is also conducting research to improve our knowledge of the complex, multi-faceted behaviour of building structures when hit by strong earthquakes.Employing the latest available seismological data, Dr. Tremblay is performing numerical simulations of building responses, as calculated using computer models of building structures subjected to seismic induced motions. Large-scale tests will also be carried out in the laboratory on key structural components. These tests are essential to validate the numerical models and verify the performance of structural elements under severe loading conditions. Realistic earthquake loads are imposed in the tests using high-performance loading equipment and sophisticated control techniques. "

His research has a triple focus: 1) Although liquidity risk has prevailed in many markets since the 2008 financial crisis, there is no consensus on its definition and measurement; 2) High-frequency trading predominates in all stock exchanges, yet experts disagree about its effects on the welfare of investors in such vehicles as pension funds; 3) The securitization risks of banks are still not effectively regulated even though poor risk management was identified as a cause of the financial crisis. The objectives of Dionne’s work are to develop better measures of liquidity risk, isolate the implications of high-frequency trading, and reinforce the financial stability of securitization risks. His research will continue to investigate problems in the relaying of information by different markets, and to study insurance, credit and operational risks. By including graduate students in his research team, Dionne will enrich their educational experience and better equip them to become future leaders in risk management. Dionne’s research results will lead to improvements in risk management and will help ensure that history does not repeat itself in financial markets when major risks arise. "

Air pollution, climate change, invasive species, and the expansion of mining, forestry, and hydroelectric development severely threaten the valuable aquatic resources of this area.Dr. John Gunn, a fisheries biologist, has for the past 25 years studied the effects of acid rain, climate change, and a variety of other environmental factors on coldwater fish communities. As the Canada Research Chair in Stressed Aquatic Systems, he is now leading a team of researchers in the study of the effects of multiple stressors on Shield ecosystems. He is also investigating the recovery processes that operate once stressors are removed. Lakes near Sudbury, Ontario, are particularly important for the recovery studies. Emissions of air pollutants in this area have declined by about 90 percent in recent decades and many aquatic systems are beginning to recover.Dr. Gunn's research program involves a combination of extensive surveys, long-term monitoring studies, and whole-lake manipulations. For example, a lake de-stratification study simulates the effects of climate warming. Large mechanical mixers are being used to alter the thermal structure of an experimental lake to test the effects of an increase in the volume of the warm surface waters on the community composition and biological production of the system. More than 20 years of background data exist for this lake. Other research efforts involve the development of new methods for environmental assessment through sampling of fish and benthic invertebrate communities in both streams and lakes. In addition, a detailed modelling study of trace metal impacts on urban and industrial lakes is being conducted. "

In most cases it conjures up the idea of self-contained, distinct ethnocultural categories and original identities solidly and permanently entrenched in space and time. It reflects a desire to recover and restore vestiges of the past, but it has little to do with creation. It involves the observation of things that are going out of existence, but seldom does it involve the observation of newly emerging phenomena. To date heritage research has focused on self-to-self transmission and paid considerably less attention to self-to-other and other-to-self transmission.Laurier Turgeon is an ethnologist and historian with a special interest in cross-cultural issues. His goal is to challenge the traditional approach to material and non-material cultural heritage and show that cultural heritage is in fact a dynamic concept by highlighting cultural movement, transformation and intermingling. Ethnological heritage, along with heritage in general, is constantly being reconstituted through contact, interaction and exchange between individuals and groups. In this context, the transmission process involves mediation and appropriation, and its impetus is conservation.To implement his program effectively as efficiently, Professor Turgeon works on three fronts. First, he focuses on developing a theory of ethnological heritage as it relates to ""métissage,"" or intermingling. His goal is to exploit and develop theoretical ideas on the intermingling of cultures as a means of exploring the ways in which hybridity influences the constitution and transmission of heritage.The second front relates to a study of the historical processes involved in the mixing of ethnological heritage, with specific reference to the Francophones of America. Rather than focusing only on old-stock Francophones, he observes and examines all groups that have been in contact with Francophones and that, in some cases, have become part of the French-speaking community. Since the intermingling processes often extend over a long period of time, he has to include time as an observation factor. Thirdly, Turgeon focuses on the issues raised by the mixing of ethnological heritage in the modern context of globalization. He is trying to identify and gain a better understanding of the ideological aspects of the intermingling of cultures. An aesthetics of heterogeneity has emerged which is intent on ""patrimonializing"" intermingling and turning it into an ideology in support of globalization. While the concept of intermixing was initially used to counter ethnicity and fundamentalism, its value has now grown to the point where it is becoming a universal aesthetics, accepted and shared by all or, if not, then imposed on others.

Clearly, the optical industry is here to stay and grow, requiring ever-increasing numbers of highly qualified engineers and scientists in photonics. At the same time, the Canadian optics industrial sector faces worldwide competition that is fiercer than ever, and the next generation of optical devices and processes must be even more efficient, less expensive, and more powerful. Both glass and plastics are used in the optical industry. Components made of glass have penetrated the markets for optical devices. Highly transparent and very easily matched to optical fibres (also made of glass), they are also inherently very stable and immune to environmental degradation. Organic materials (plastics) are also finding niche applications for certain optical processes and will certainly gain importance in the future. The research activity of Dr. Jacques Albert, Canada Research Chair in Advanced Photonic Components, is concentrated on the use of laser light to process glass and organic waveguide materials. (Most materials in which light waveguides are fabricated can be permanently modified when subjected to intense laser irradiation.) His goal is to fabricate novel devices for routing and coding optical signals. He and his team are creating complex structures, such as filters and couplers, in basic optical waveguides, which provide greater functionality and market value while preserving low fabrication costs. The devices are being submitted to rigorous environmental testing to ensure their reliability and conformity to international standards. To fabricate these complex devices, Dr. Albert and a team of researchers have put together a versatile laser processing laboratory, which will become a training ground for experts in photonics and provide Canadian industry with new processes and devices for the next generations of optical systems.

Most recently, the Human Genome Project (ending in 2003) has provided us with a complete picture of the 30,000 to 35,000 genes present in human DNA. Now scientists are ready to discover how these genes function in creating the unique traits of each human being and in determining important aspects of our health and disease.Each human gene contains a set of instructions on how to make proteins, which perform the most important genetic functions associated with human life. Canada Research Chair in Structural Proteomics Cheryl Arrowsmith stands at the forefront of structural proteomics-the discipline that studies the structures, functions, and interactions of the proteins encoded by our genes. Her lab uses nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMR) to visualize the structures of these proteins at a much faster rate than has ever before been possible.In April 2003, Industry Minister Allan Rock announced the formation of the Structural Genomics Consortium (SGC), the largest health research project ever funded in Canada. The consortium represents a collaboration between British and Canadian scientists who will work on characterizing more than 350 genome-related proteins. Ultimately, the SGC's work will lead to the development of new drugs and treatments for many of today's prevalent diseases, such as cancer and neurological disorders. As director of the Canadian research team, Dr. Arrowsmith is spearheading the effort in Canada, and the resulting data is being placed in public databases, making the data available for all researchers.

For some, however, social interaction is more difficult. It seems that difficulties with relationships predispose some children to a litany of negative outcomes, including dropping out of school, youth crime and mental health problems. This raises questions as to the nature, causes and development of the difficulties concerned.As chairholder, Professor Boivin plans to address these issues head on by tracking the development of children from birth to adolescence. With this in mind, he will draw on an impressive collection of major population studies, including one on twins. In theses studies, over 3000 Quebec children are assessed periodically from birth onward, along with their families.The children have been assessed on various aspects of social interaction in a family and childcare setting. They will now be monitored in school. From kindergarten on, they will be questioned and observed in different social settings and their emotional reactions will be measured. In this way it will be possible to evaluate and more accurately define the relationship between a number of prior experiences and the quality of social and school integration.The tracking process will enable Professor Boivin to examine a variety of development paths and more effectively document the nature, causes and effects of problematic social relationships during childhood. Over the medium term, the findings will provide for more accurate identification of children at psychosocial risk. It will also be possible to target preventive measures more precisely and design new, effective preventive methods involving peers. The ultimate goal is to lower the incidence of the negative experiences concerned and lessen their impact on children at risk. "

Carpendale and her research team are creating “interactive information visualizations” that support people’s daily work and social practices. Put another way, the idea is to create visual representations of information in a manner that allows people to interact with, manipulate, and explore it easily. Interactive visualization is about how people can use dense and complex information more efficiently. The goal is to enable people to see information in a way that is easy for them to understand, so they can more easily make decisions based on it. Interactive visualization is becoming an indispensable tool in tasks such as information communication, retrieval, exploration and manipulation, decision making, and mining.

It is caused by the spiral-shaped bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi and by other related bacteria. The disease is typically transmitted from infected mice to humans by a bite from an infected tick. If not properly diagnosed and treated, lyme borreliosis can be severely debilitating and result in arthritis, neurological symptoms, heart abnormalities, and a host of other ailments. The bacteria causing lyme borreliosis carry their genetic material in an unusual manner. While most bacteria have a single circular chromosome, the genetic material in Borrelia is segmented and made up of more than 20 separate pieces of DNA. Moreover, most of these DNA segments are not circular, but linear, and contain hairpin ends or “telomeres.” The unusual structure of the genetic material in Borrelia raises the question of how this material is copied and faithfully passed from generation to generation. George Chaconas, a DNA and protein biochemist, is devoting his time as Canada Research Chair in the Molecular Biology of Lyme Borreliosis to studying the unique process by which the telomeres are generated in B. burgdorferi. His lab is also pursuing studies related to the copying of the genetic material and the distribution of the copied molecules so that each new cell carries a full copy of all the genes. As well, Chaconas is trying to understand the mechanism of “antigenic variation,” whereby B. burgdorferi can avoid being killed off by the immune system in the infected organism. Finally, he is hoping to identify and study the proteins from B. burgdorferi that interact specifically with human proteins as part of the disease-causing process. All this will add up to a better understanding of the complex processes of a very unusual disease-causing organism, and may well lead to the development of drugs to either block or treat infection.

Most cancer deaths are caused by metastasis - the spread of cancer to new organs - rather than by the primary tumor. For many patients, metastasis has already begun when their cancer is discovered. In other patients, cancer that may appear to have been eliminated could return after several years. Until now, there have been few effective treatments available once cancer has spread. However, research by Dr. Ann Chambers, Canada Research Chair in Oncology, suggests that there are treatment opportunities at several steps after cancer has started to spread. Chambers has identified a promising approach to treatment that involves inhibiting the growth of tiny micro-metastases.

To maintain their livelihood, these communities rely on both continued value creation in the economy surrounding these forest networks, as well as on sustainable business strategies.Recently, forest networks have been identified as a possible solution to mitigate the effects of climate change. Suggested remedies, such as carbon sequestration in forests and wood products, as well as the use of fossil fuels and energy-intensive materials like concrete or steel, provide new economic opportunities in Canada’s forest networks. Still, these opportunities are difficult to harness and transform into sustainable and profitable practices. The complexity of these logistics has so far led to tightly focused, single-step solutions, where forest networks are mostly transformed into low-cost commodities, rather than to integrated systems or high value solutions that benefit the long-term interests of the communities or industry.

As the Canada Research Chair in Developmental Neuropathology, Dr. Marc Del Bigio is combining his expertise in both the clinical and research arenas to determine how acquired brain disorders, such as hydrocephalus, hemorrhage, and toxin exposure, damage the immature brain and negatively affect its development, resulting in disorders like cerebral palsy. A practicing neuropathologist, Dr. Del Bigio is recognized as one of the world's leading authorities on hydrocephalus-a common neurological disorder characterized by the expansion of fluid-filled cavities in the centre of the brain. He is using animal models that are faithful to human disorders to determine whether treatment is possible. His models have allowed him to make smooth transitions from human disease to animal modelling at the behavioural, structural, biochemical, and molecular levels, and back again. Brain swelling is associated with head injury and stroke, and it is often the complication that causes the death of affected people or that contributes to a poor outcome for people suffering these forms of injury.

It's an old axiom, confirmed by psychologists and health-care specialists who regularly observe the psychological factors that directly influence the state of our health. But what kind of psychological behaviour is harmful and how exactly does it influence or even trigger health problems?For Dr. Gordon Flett, personality is the key to many health problems stemming from stress and the inability to cope with stress. He believes that certain aspects of the personality trait of perfectionism can be particularly harmful as an extreme form of behaviour. Dr. Flett co-developed with Dr. Paul Hewitt, the Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale, a model reconstruction of both the personal and interpersonal components of perfectionism. Subsequent research efforts based on this model have firmly established that perfectionism has personal and interpersonal components and is associated with various forms of maladjustment, including depression, anxiety and suicidal tendencies.As the Canada Research Chair in Personality and Health, Dr. Flett is further exploring the relationship between perfectionism and psychological disorders, including eating disorders and postpartum depression. He is expanding his research to include the role of perfectionism in the treatment of and recovery from physical illnesses. He is also taking a close look at the role of perfectionists in contributing to stress and distress in their adolescent children, and the transmission of this personality trait from parent to child.

But scientists have long puzzled over why the world is not also made of antimatter, which only occurs naturally in cosmic ray collisions. They believe the Big Bang should have created the same amount of matter and antimatter and, in theory, the two should have wiped each other out as matter and antimatter annihilate one another on impact and disappear. So what's going on?The successful production of antimatter last fall by two teams of scientists working at the CERN particle physics laboratory in Geneva made headlines around the world. The teams, ATHENA and ATRAP, appeared to have entered a realm once reserved for science fiction. But a reality check by the ATRAP (Antihydrogen Trap) team not only confirmed that antihydrogen could be produced, but trapped the antiatoms long enough to catch a glimpse of their structure. It was the start of experiments that may unlock more of the mysteries of the birth of universe, with Dr. Eric Hessels on the ATRAP team spearheading Canada's contribution.As Canada Research Chair in Atomic Physics, Dr. Hessels, along with his team at York University, is working with ATRAP at Harvard University on a method to trap the antiatoms long enough to conduct experiments. His work also involves measuring the energies and orbits of helium atoms to provide the most accurate measurement of the ""fine structure constant,"" the fundamental constant of nature that determines the strength of the electric and magnetic forces between charged objects. This fundamental constant is not only relevant to magnets and electricity, but to how atoms, chemicals, and solid objects are held together. "

And most of these intra-state conflicts are ethnic conflicts, between the members of different ethno-cultural groups. A crucial task facing the international community, therefore, is to develop guidelines and principles for how such ethnic conflicts should be resolved, or prevented from arising in the first place. One promising approach is to try to develop international norms for the treatment of ethno-cultural groups, so as to avoid the sorts of grievances that can lead to violent conflict. This would involve developing something like a ""universal charter of minority rights,"" akin to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights adopted by the United Nations in 1948. Tentative steps have been taken in this direction by various international organizations, such as the United Nations and the Council of Europe. However, there is not yet a global consensus on the nature of the rights that should be guaranteed to ethno-cultural minorities. Indeed, many countries resist the very idea that there should be international monitoring of how states treat their minorities. Other obstacles to an international consensus on minority rights include differences in cultural traditions, concerns about state security, the priority of democratic consolidation and economic development over minority rights, the difficulty of defining universal categories of minority groups, and the need for locally designed solutions. The goal of Dr. Will Kymlicka as the Canada Research Chair in Political Philosophy is to explore these disagreements and the potential for resolving them. By comparing the way ethnic conflicts are managed and debated in various parts of the world, his research is helping to reveal the prospects for achieving a global consensus on minority rights. "

However, specific difficulties arise when the systems to be simulated contain random components. Take the example of a business that does not know ahead of time what the demand for a particular product will be, or that of a communication or transportation network where there is no advance information on traffic volume at each point in the network. In order to use simulations to study and potentially optimize management of systems such as these, the first step required is to build mathematical models that accurately represent the behavioural aspects of interest-for example, quality of service in a network or revenues and expenses of a business. It is then possible to generate a computer simulation of changes in the models and optimize their parameters using specially designed algorithms or heuristics.Computer generators of random values are a key component of any simulation involving a random variable. They are also an essential feature of computer games, gambling machines (lottery terminals), and communications security systems (cryptology). Quality criteria for generators vary with the application concerned-hence the need to study them from various standpoints and build several types.An expert in the simulation of stochastic systems, Pierre L'Écuyer will devote part of his time as chairholder to developing and studying effective methods of simulating systems with random components and to optimizing systems of this kind by means of simulation-based methods. He will focus on the application of such methods in a variety of fields, including finance, risk management, communications, and management of business operations.He will also continue his research on the design, mathematical analysis, effective use and statistical testing of generators of random values for a variety of applications. He is recognized as a world authority in this field. At the same time, he wilI study quasi-Monte Carlo methods for large-scale digital integration and the close links between these methods and the construction of high-quality generators of random values.Dr. L'Écuyer will examine the mathematical and the theoretical aspects of these questions, including algorithm convergence analysis and mathematical analysis of the structure of points produced by generators or by digital integration methods, and the practical aspects, such as software implementation and experimentation.

Integrating the fields of visual psychology, computer vision, robotics, and visual neuroscience, he is developing robotic wheelchairs for the disabled that can be controlled by vision. His research in active vision (computer vision systems equipped with cameras that move and attend to items of interest), motion recognition, and mobile robotics will benefit Canadian industry and the health sciences by advancing software and hardware design and application, as well as by developing better medical diagnostic tools and biomedical visual and motor devices for use by disabled children and adults.Dr. Tsotsos has led many experimental efforts in active vision. As well, he designed and implemented the first computerized motion recognition system, showing that visual motion converted into digital image sequences can be automatically detected, quantified, and interpreted by a computer. This work was applied to cardiology, providing the first example of an automated system to assess the performance of the left ventricle from X-ray image sequences.In addition, Dr. Tsotsos showed for the first time that methods of theoretical computer science could be applied to the analysis of biological vision, leading to computer processing architectures for explaining vision problems in the brain. He was the first to formally prove that tasks or specialized knowledge play a critical role in managing human perception. He developed the Selective Tuning Model (STM) for visual attention, which is widely considered the leading model for consolidating current understanding of the process of visual attention.

They were formed later through complex physical processes involving gravitation, hydrodynamics and atomic physics. Explaining the process of formation and evolution of stars and galaxies is a major challenge for modern astrophysics.Hugo Martel will set up a research program in theoretical and numerical astrophysics for studying star and galaxy formation and the evolution of galaxies and the intergalactic environment. It will require the development of numerical simulation software, semi-analytical models and visualization techniques.The first phase of the program will comprise four projects: (1) formation and evolution of clusters of galaxies; (2) reionization of the universe and its effect on galaxy formation; (3) formation of star clusters through fragmentation of molecular clouds; and (4) development of dense cores in molecular clouds. Dr. Martel and a number of associates in the U.S., Europe and Mexico have already launched these projects, three of which have received substantial financial support from NASA.The involvement of many observers at Université Laval will significantly strengthen the research program.

Wood products, cotton, dietary fibre, and paper all reflect the unique properties of plant cells that enable them to expand in diverse ways. Understanding the basic mechanisms that underlie the growth and development of plant cells is an essential first step toward harnessing their biotechnological potential.As Canada Research Chair in Plant Cell Biology, Dr. Geoffrey Wasteneys is discovering factors that shape plant cells. Combining molecular genetics with state of the art microscopy, his research has already identified proteins that drive the cell-shaping machinery.In structure, plant cell walls closely resemble advanced composite materials like Kevlar, with microscopic cellulose polymers embedded in a matrix substance. Mechanical properties of plant cell walls are determined through interactions between cellulose and matrix components. These interactions are in turn regulated by processes occurring within the cell that are co-ordinated by a network of filamentous proteins known as the cytoskeleton. The major area of Dr Wasteneys' research is concentrated on understanding how the cytoskeleton regulates cell wall composition, structure, and mechanical properties.Part of Dr. Wasteneys' research program is also devoted to developing fertilization-independent seed production in crop plants. The idea is to stimulate specialized cells to revert to stem cell status and then develop into embryos. This occurs naturally in certain plants, but rarely in agriculturally important ones. Enabling crop plants to produce seed without fertilization will have enormous benefits for propagating large numbers of hybrid seeds, which is currently not practical in major Canadian crops like wheat.Dr. Wasteneys is using an innovative combination of technologies to gain a clearer understanding of the subcellular mechanisms that shape plant cells and that enable specialized cells to be reprogrammed into embryos. Identifying and understanding the complexity of these mechanisms will lead to biotechnological applications ranging from the improvement of fibre properties for the forestry industry to the harnessing of fertilization-independent seed production for agriculture.

At the same time, too much calcium is toxic for cells, and therefore calcium levels in nerve cells have to be precisely regulated. One of the essential mechanisms by which calcium can enter nerve cells is through a family of proteins called ""calcium channels."" There are at least 10 different types of calcium channels, each of which is associated with a specialized function in the brain. Because of their importance for brain function, they are important drug targets in disorders such as epilepsy and pain. In addition, genetic abnormalities in calcium channels are linked to diseases such as night blindness, migraine and ataxia.Dr. Gerald Zamponi is an internationally recognized expert in the area of calcium-channel molecular biology. As Canada Research Chair in Molecular Neuroscience, he is focusing his energies on trying to figure out how calcium channels contribute to brain disorders. He hopes to develop strategies to regulate calcium-channel function for therapeutic intervention. Using a combination of molecular biology, electrophysiology, protein biochemistry, optical imaging, and gene-knockout mice, Zamponi looks at how nerve cells control the activity and trafficking of various types of calcium channels, and how naturally occurring mutations in calcium-channel genes contribute to disease processes. Zamponi also works in partnership with the biotechnology sector, developing small drug molecules that target calcium channels in order to treat chronic pain. Currently, 12 per cent of the Canadian population aged 12 or older experience chronic pain, and, to date, there has been no treatment without debilitating side effects. Zamponi's work also has broader implications for our current basic understanding of the mechanisms that underlie nerve-to-nerve communication in the central nervous system. Advances in the understanding of brain function at the molecular level will ultimately result in the development of better therapeutics, thus improving the health and well-being of Canadians, as well as reducing the impact of disease on the Canadian economy.

They are caused by the ""template-directed misfolding"" of normal prion protein resulting from physical contact with an abnormal, disease-specific prion protein. The functions of most proteins depend upon the precise three-dimensional structures of their mature, folded forms; when misfolding occurs, problems arise. Template-directed protein misfolding may also play a role in other neurodegenerative syndromes, including Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and Parkinson's disease.

In order to combat these illnesses, a greater understanding of how the brain functions at the molecular and cellular level is necessary. Furthermore, if we can learn how nerve cells form connections during development, we can develop therapies for regenerating connections following injury.Canada Research Chair Dr. Ann Marie Craig is a Canadian-trained neuroscientist who has returned to Canada from the United States to lead an effort to understand how nerve cells form and modify synaptic connections. Her group uses a combination of fluorescence imaging, molecular biology, and electrophysiology to investigate how nerve cells communicate. By studying nerve cells growing in a dish, the scientists have already begun to identify molecular signals on the surface of nerve cells that induce contacting partners to form a synaptic connection. Mutations in one of these molecular cues has recently been linked to autism. Dr. Craig and her team are also studying how neurotransmitter receptors are localized and modified to control the strength of synaptic signalling between nerve cells. One type of glutamate receptor under study is a mediator of synaptic changes during learning and memory, and thus is a target for drug studies to limit pathological consequences of stroke.Synapses are the basic units of communication in the brain. Thus the knowledge gained from understanding synapse development and modification has broad implications for the treatment of all neurological diseases and mental illnesses.

So says Dr. Louis Fortier, Canada Research Chair on the Response of Marine Arctic Ecosystems to Global Warming, who believes the result could be an enriched Arctic Ocean whose ecosystems will provide improved services.With greenhouse gas emissions increasing and the Earth’s lower atmosphere heating up, surface temperatures at high Arctic latitudes have already increased by two degrees centigrade in recent years. At the current rate, ice in the central Arctic Ocean, which has resisted the summer melt for at least three million years, could disappear by the summer of 2020. Fortier believes current Arctic ecosystems will likely be replaced by the ecosystems typically seen in the North Atlantic and North Pacific. While this will increase the Arctic ocean’s biological productivity, it will likely result in unique biodiversity loss, including the disappearance of several popular animals (polar bears, walruses, seals and marine birds).To determine the effects warming could have on the region, Fortier is examining key links in the Arctic marine food chain, such as copepods (small crustaceans) and Arctic cod. These species carry out the bulk of energy transfer between photosynthetic microalgae and the marine mammals and birds that the Inuit depend on. Fortier’s research will enable scientists to better anticipate the impact of changes underway in Arctic marine ecosystems and to formulate strategies that will allow us to adapt to changes in the availability of marine resources.

Most infections occur in childhood and cause no symptoms; however, in adolescents and adults, EBV can cause infectious mononucleosis. It has also been associated with certain forms of cancer. The EBNA1 protein of EBV is responsible for replicating and maintaining the viral genome in cells and may directly contribute to the rapid, uncontrolled proliferation of cells and tumour formation.A recognized leader in medical genetics and microbiology research, Dr. Lori Frappier studies how EBNA1 contributes to cell proliferation and tumour formation and the cellular proteins involved. She has determined how EBNA1 binds to EBV DNA, an essential process for the replication and maintenance of the virus. She has also played a critical role in adapting a tagging method for purifying protein complexes taken from human cells, a method that has since been used to identify several new cellular protein interactions between the EBNA1 protein and human cellular replication proteins. Dr. Frappier herself has made crucial strides towards a better understanding of cellular protein interactions with the EBNA1 protein - interactions that are potential drug targets for the treatment or prevention of EBV-related cancers.Dr. Frappier's highly innovative and interdisciplinary research has identified a cellular protein called EBP2, which is a component of cellular chromosomes. Through a specific interaction with EBP2, EBNA1 attaches the EBV's DNA to a dividing cell's chromosomes, allowing the virus's DNA to be divided equally between the two daughter cells. This phenomenon of ""hitch-hiking"" on cellular chromosomes is seen with several persistent viruses and is an important part of why they are able to persist in dividing cells. As the Canada Research Chair in Molecular Virology, Dr. Frappier is continuing her work in medical genetics as she works on the development of gene therapy as well as new patent applications and additional interactions with industry.

They were seen only as conduit tubes back then, but we now know that they are intricate “living pipes” with different layers and cell types, and the ability to coordinate and control blood pressure and well-being to the whole body. Dr. Colin Funk, Canada Research Chair in Molecular, Cellular and Physiological Medicine, is studying how these “living pipes” or blood vessels function in normal health and in disease. Fatty build up forming plaque within the vessel wall (atherosclerosis) occurs over many years and leads eventually to rupture and heart attacks. The largest artery in the body, the aorta, can sometimes bulge (aortic aneurysm) and eventually rupture, with catastrophic consequences. Funk is exploring the signalling pathways in these various disorders. Specific lipid mediators (chemical messengers that are released in response to tissue injury) that are made by blood vessels and from white blood cells can control normal homeostasis (ability of cells to maintain internal balance). They can also control how much inflammation occurs in the heart during atherosclerosis and aortic aneurysm. Funk’s research will lead to better understanding of how the vessels function and adapt in health and disease. His research could also lead to new drug strategies to combat the devastating effects of heart attacks and aneurysms. "

Canada Research Chair Dr. Jamie K. Scott is working to develop vaccines that will stimulate the immune system to selectively produce these neutralizing and protective antibodies. The scientists in Dr. Scott's lab use a peptide library technology that she developed to identify certain peptides (small protein fragments that bind specifically to the protective antibodies). Their goal is to find peptides that specifically target each neutralizing antibody, and then use the peptides as immunogens that induce the production of each of the targeted antibodies. Dr. Scott is also working to identify new neutralizing antibodies that are produced early in the immune response against HIV-1 infection, as these antibodies may be easier to target by her procedure. When individuals are infected with HIV-1, they typically elicit a strong antibody response that neutralizes the virus. These neutralizing antibodies, however, cannot clear the virus and stop the infection once it has begun. Since HIV-1 is highly mutable, it produces variants that can escape the neutralizing antibodies. The immune system then produces a new antibody response, but again, viral mutants arise that escape it. Thus, neutralizing antibodies may help to suppress the virus (until the immune system fails), but cannot clear infection. Broadly neutralizing antibodies, which neutralize most HIV-1 variants, have been isolated from infected people, and these, when administered to non-human primates, protect against infection by viruses that bear the HIV-1 envelope and cause an AIDS-like disease. Passive immunization with these antibodies is the only procedure tested so far that produces sterilizing protection from infection with HIV-1. Thus, Dr. Scott and her colleagues are working to produce vaccines that target the production of antibodies similar or identical to the protective ones found so far. Their approach to making ""designer"" immunogens that bind specifically to the protective antibodies has promising implications for the development of vaccines against AIDS, and for other emerging infectious diseases.

Virtually all neurological disorders have inflammatory components, and these include diseases traditionally associated with inflammation, including multiple sclerosis, and those previously thought to be purely degenerative, such as Alzheimer's.Neuroinflammation originates from the movement of leukocytes (white blood cells) into the nervous system and through the production of immune molecules by neural cells themselves. The interaction between leukocytes and neural cells further promotes neuroinflammation and injury. In recent years, scientists have learned to appreciate the reparative properties of neuroinflammation and to understand that there is but a short distance between beneficial and detrimental neuroinflammation. As the Canada Research Chair in Neuroimmunology, Dr. V. Wee Yong is researching three diseases of the central nervous system (CNS): multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, and brain tumours (gliomas). Multiple sclerosis and spinal cord injury because they are diseases of chronic and acute neuroinflammation, respectively, and malignant gliomas, because it is a disease of immunosuppression, wherein cancer cells neutralize the activity of leukocytes that infiltrate the tumours. In the short term, Dr. Yong's studies are aimed at understanding and controlling neuroinflammation. In the longer term, his goals are to find ways to tip the balance of neuroinflammation towards one of neuroprotection and regeneration, so that meaningful recovery from CNS insults such as multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, and brain tumours can result. In addition, since neuroimmunology has an impact on most nervous system disorders, Dr. Yong hopes his research will benefit a spectrum of other neurological diseases. "

Radiation is everywhere. Rocks produce a natural form called radon. Anyone who has had a chest or dental X-ray has been exposed to man-made radiation. And highly sophisticated medical imaging techniques are used to treat life-threatening deformities or diseases. Yet most of us are frightened of radiation because we've heard about the terrible effects of high doses experienced during atomic bomb explosions or nuclear reactor meltdowns. This level of exposure, however, is never even approached during the controlled use of radiation where strict regulations are in place to ensure safety. Still the question remains: Just how dangerous are low doses?Canada Research Chair Dr. Carmel Mothersill is a radiobiologist who has studied low-dose radiation effects for several years. In her research, she studies the effects of low-dose exposures to cells derived from humans and other species. She is interested in the long-term changes in the behaviour of cells; changes, for example, in how they grow and how they communicate. The information derived from her research helps put radiation risks in context given the benefits of the medical use of radiation. In addition her research is used to help detect potential problems by using sensitive tests that employ cultured cells and small tissue explants and do not involve experiments on animals. Dr. Mothersill's research suggests that low doses of radiation have very different effects compared to high doses. Cells appear to be able to adapt to low doses and to organize cell and tissue responses through sophisticated communication systems. The death of one or two cells in the population, which could be a consequence of low-dose exposure, is therefore not a problem for the tissue. As she explores this issue, Dr. Mothersill is also looking at the relative sensitivities of individual humans and non-human species to low-dose exposures to see if any are extra-sensitive and whether exposure to a little radiation is dangerous.

The true complexity of the cell nucleus and its activities is only now coming to light. We know, for instance, that the several nuclear organelles that make up the nucleus are disrupted in human disease, but we don't yet fully understand how. Their molecular function is still a mystery. That's why Dr. Borden's research is so relevant. She studies how the function of the nuclear organelles is related to their physiological activities in cell transformation and in hematopoiesis (the formation and development of blood cells). In particular, she focuses on the eukaryotic translation imitation factor or eIF4E and its negative regulator, the promyelocytic leukemia protein PML. The nuclear body eIF4E can inappropriately alter gene expression by increasing the transport of growth-promoting transcripts into the cytoplasm, which includes the entire contents of the cell outside the nucleus. This activity significantly contributes to the nucleus's ability to transform cells.

But aside from the devastation they cause, these diseases have something else in common: In each of them, as in countless others, calcium plays in an important role. Calcium regulates and controls numerous cellular processes. Beginning in early development and continuing through to adulthood, calcium is the messenger that carries signals vital for human development. The fertilization of human eggs, for instance, requires a calcium signal within the cell, which ultimately influences its fate. Any misstep in cell signalling can cause cell growth to go awry and cancer to develop. Because calcium is vital to all aspects of health and disease, it is imperative that its functions be examined and understood.As the Canada Research Chair in Structural Biology, Dr. Mitsuhiko Ikura researches how calcium functions as a cellular messenger in the body. His lab uses NMR, X-ray, and imaging technologies as well as multidisciplinary techniques to obtain information about the shapes and locations of the molecules involved in calcium signalling.Dr. Ikura is confident that his research program will provide clues into how calcium impacts cardiovascular function, and vital information about what therapeutic treatments may be helpful in restoring normal heart function.

How can surfaces be made that are highly resistant to contamination? Dr. Guojun Liu, Canada Research Chair in Materials Science, thinks the answers may come from the development of polymeric materials. These materials comprise both natural and synthetic materials with a wide variety of properties.Liu is developing micelles (or submicroscopic aggregations of molecules) that drastically reduce friction of lubricating oils in engines and machinery, thus reducing wear and improving fuel economy. Not only will this technology save money, but it will also reduce waste, making it environmentally-beneficial. Liu has also developed a technology that can coat textiles and windows and make their surfaces highly oil- and water-repellent. Since these surfaces can remain clean for a long time, they reduce costs and save energy.While the polymeric materials that Liu develops will have wide-ranging applications, they will share the common benefits of energy and costs savings.

It is still used extensively by the military for that purpose, as well as for navigation, surveillance, and targeting. Civilian applications of infrared vision started in 1965 with the availability of the first commercial infrared camera. For years, it developed slowly due to the high cost of the equipment and the low quality of available images. Today, however, the availability of new generations of infrared cameras coupled with growing computer power is providing exciting new opportunities for enterprising scientists such as Dr. Xavier Maldague.Canada Research Chair Dr. Maldague is a world-renowned expert in infrared thermography, the electronic technique that uses infrared vision to see thermal energy, to monitor temperatures and thermal patterns. In his research, Dr. Maldague tries to solve key problems limiting the use of infrared vision in civilian applications, such as how to enhance the ""vision"" of the subtle temperature changes of a surface that indicate the presence of a buried defect. In addition, he explores new aspects of infrared vision in numerical simulations of thermal phenomena in health sciences, law enforcement, the environment, and biofood sciences. In biofood sciences, for example, infrared vision is used to study and model wholesomeness and preservation of refrigerated food that must not reach certain temperature levels or harmful bacteria will develop rapidly. In the case of ""precision agriculture,"" portable systems with infrared imaging processing are being developed to help evaluate plant metabolism with respect to light, watering, and nitrogen supply. These systems will help preserve the environment by ensuring that the plants only get what they need, leading to a great deal less waste. "

In his role as the Canada Research Chair in Cellular Signalling, Dr. Sylvain Meloche studies the regulation of a specific cell cycle regulator by growth factors and tumour suppressors. He is also examining the role of certain signalling pathways in cell proliferation and tumour genesis and conducting a biochemical and genetic analysis of a family of proteins involved in these pathways. To carry out his research, Dr. Meloche uses a multidisciplinary approach that combines cell biology, chemical genetics, murine genetics, functional genomics, and structural biology. His judicious use of biochemistry and cell biology techniques, combined with studies of model organisms, is making it possible to identify the signalling effectors and pathways that play key roles in cell cycle progression, cell proliferation, self-renewal, and neoplastic transformation. Assisted by the availability of whole-genome information on human beings and the spectacular improvements in functional genomics, computational approaches, and structural biology, Dr. Meloche is able to study gene function at many different levels in the context of the whole organism.Dr. Meloche's Chair is part of a cluster of Canada Research Chairs that make up the core of the Université de Montréal's Institute of Research in Immunovirology and Cancerology (IRIC).

It affects an estimated two million Canadians and one out of fifteen people in the Western world. The main problem for those with the disease is resistance to insulin, a hormone that allows muscles to use dietary sugars (glucose) to produce energy for activity. In those with type II diabetes, insulin-sensitive tissues lose the ability to respond properly to insulin, ushering in a host of complications including circulatory defects, blindness, and cardiovascular disease, which carries an increased risk of death.Dr. Amira Klip, a leading researcher in cell biology, is breaking new ground in diabetes research in two specific areas. In one, she is unravelling the fine details of insulin signalling with insulin-sensitive tissues; in the other, she is characterizing the final step of insulin action in muscle.Her work focuses on the molecular mechanisms whereby insulin increases the number and function of glucose ""entry ports""-also known as glucose transporters (GLUTs)-on muscle cells, in order to increase glucose uptake. A 2000 Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada, Dr. Klip used cell biology and biochemical methods to identify these entry ports for glucose, both for muscle cells and across the blood-brain barrier. She found that insulin causes a type of glucose transporter known as GLUT4 to move from inside the cell to the muscle plasma membrane, in order to bring glucose into the cell.As the Canada Research Chair in Cell Biology of Insulin Action, Dr. Klip is further clarifying the mobilization and activation of GLUT4, with an emphasis on defining which of the many steps involved may be defective (and potentially reversible) in type II diabetes. By clarifying the molecular details of these phenomena, Dr. Klip's research is generating new approaches to combating insulin resistance and diabetes. "

Such research areas build on fundamental scientific research that provides the foundation on which important solutions are based. One such area is pure mathematics. Canada Research Chair Dr. Vladimir Chernousov is an internationally renowned expert in the theory of linear algebraic groups. He conducts research focused on understanding the nature of algebraic groups and their classification. His research has made substantial contributions to the study of linear algebraic groups over non-closed fields. Understanding symmetry, such as how and why it arises, is a fundamental component in both mathematics and physics.The mathematical objects that measure symmetry are called groups and their study is known as group theory. Classical examples of continuous groups are rotations (e.g., all the different positions that the needle of a compass can assume) and translations (e.g., imagine a train track that runs forever on a straight line in both directions); an example of a discrete group is the symmetry of a square or a snowflake. The first two examples are ones of continuous groups of motions (points in our imaginary track that can arbitrarily be closed to each other), while the symmetries of a snowflake or a square are discrete (you cannot continuously move a square into itself . . . unless you do not move at all)Though most groups by nature have a geometrical flavour, it has proven crucial for contemporary mathematicians to find the correct kind of group that could be used to deal with purely algebraic or arithmetical questions. These are the so-called algebraic groups. The focus of Dr. Chernousov's present research is on a particular mathematical framework called ""non-abelian Galois cohomology"" and on the splitting properties of the corresponding algebraic groups.

Bush delivered his policy speech on embryonic stem cell research, what may not have been evident during this televised event was the conflict playing out behind the scenes between two domestic institutions. On one side was the religious right, supporting a total ban; on the other was the ""national innovation system"" (consisting of university research and biotech and pharmaceutical firms), which opposes the ban. In spite of the obvious health and ethical questions surrounding embryonic stem cell research, what really prompted this televised policy speech was the issue of competitiveness and what it would mean to the American economy if a ban was put into force. As the Canada Research Chair in Competitiveness and Prosperity, Dr. Daniel Trefler is researching the influence of domestic institutions on a nation's economic development, and how this influence relates to a nation's ability to be internationally competitive. His research program consists of two themes: how domestic institutions can be a decisive determinant on international trade and competitiveness, and how international trade influences the evolution of a nation's domestic institutions. Dr. Trefler is making important advances in an area that has received little attention to date. By examining whether domestic institutions help or harm a nation's international competitiveness, and whether international competition positively or negatively influences a nation's domestic institutions, he is setting the tone of future work on international competitiveness and economic development.

One project considers the work of central agencies inside government. The other examines government departments and agencies and the notion of empowerment and its impact on the relationship between government and citizens. In brief, one project will look inside the machinery of government and how the parts relate to each other while the second will explore how the machinery relates to citizens.The two research projects will have a strong comparative perspective. I will be focusing my efforts on four countries: Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom and France. The four countries share some common political traditions and concepts, but also present a range of structural (federal and unitary), political (presidential, semi-presidential and parliamentary) and administration variables.The relationship between elected and non-elected officials and citizens is being redefined more by stealth than by highly visible structural changes. The New Public Management and its theme ""empowerment,"" as well as new information technologies (e-democracy and e-government) are reshaping how Canadians relate to government.My research will explore these two broad issues.

We are surrounded in our daily lives by the fruit derived from work in this area, from the heating wire in our toasters to the components of our computers. Without the discoveries made by condensed matter physicists, we wouldn't have this technology. The modern electronic age is founded on a century of research into the quantum mechanics of condensed matter. Despite the incredible sophistication of modern electronic devices from an engineering point of view, these devices rely on well-established physical principles. Yet there are a host of properties of matter - recently discovered by condensed matter physicists - that could potentially be used in electronic devices, if only they were better understood. The study of these special properties of matter, which arise from strong electron-electron interactions, provokes great intellectual excitement among condensed matter physicists such as Dr. Stephen Julian, and is of vital importance to the long-term future of electronic device development. As the Canada Research Chair in Low Temperature Physics, Dr. Julian is leading a research program that involves the establishment of a Canadian centre for high-pressure research.

Pressure is mounting on other provinces and territories to devise similar plans. There also has been a marked increase in anti-poverty activism, such as living wage campaigns, in many Canadian cities. Dr. Janine Brodie, Canada Research Chair in Citizenship and Social Governance, is examining and assessing these anti-poverty initiatives. She notes there are significant differences between the programs, and that they provide a remarkable living laboratory to study the reframing of social welfare policies in Canada. The programs emerge from an economy that is increasingly characterized by low-paying and often precarious service-sector employment. As well, there has been a notable absence of innovative policy leadership at the federal level, and responsibility for such programs has increasingly shifted to the provinces and municipalities. Her research is focusing on the differences in design and budgets in the programs, their various definitions of poverty, the solutions they offer, and the political processes that have achieved these policy innovations. Brodie’s research will not only assess the differences in the programs, but provide examples of best practices in social welfare policies and examine their importance in a changing economic and political environment.

Few Canadians would think to include religion among the forces that animated the great changes in Russia between the 19th century and the rise of Soviet socialism. Yet then, as in other times, religion was central to the life of the Russian state. No mere vestige of a pre-modern past, it was a living force - both a bastion of imperial power and, in the hands of missionaries and local priests, a site for negotiation between different nationalities and cultural traditions. Canada Research Chair Dr. Heather Coleman is examining the role of religion in modern nation-building. She is focusing on the experiences of Orthodox priests in the diocese of Kyiv (then Kiev) in the Russian Ukraine - a centre of Russian Orthodoxy, a hotbed of both Russian and Ukrainian nationalism, but also the home of Polish Catholics and Jewish citizens who maintained close ties to their religious and cultural heritage. Dr. Coleman is trying to answer such questions as, How did the priests try to deal with these differences? Which of them tried to win local allegiance to the idea of the Russian nation, and why? How did they grapple with ideas of what it means to be ""Russian,"" what it means to be ""Ukrainian""? How did they represent themselves, and the Church, to the communities they served? In the process, her study is shedding light on the role of religious feeling in political relations, and revealing more about the ways in which modern identities are shaped. "

These forests contribute to how our climate is moderated by filtering air and water, regenerating soil, and preventing erosion. With increasing population and the subsequent demand on resources, the sustainable development and management of our forests has become of outstanding importance. Remote sensing can deliver a range of social, economic, environmental, and scientific benefits to forestry management. It can, for example, create imagery to assess fire fuel hazard potential and pest and disease outbreaks in both native and planted forests. By integrating current and next-generation remote-sensing data with geographical and terrain information, scientists are able to provide solutions that are cost-effective and accurate. Nicholas Coops is an expert in developing models, hardware, and software that allow remote sensing and other geographical and terrain information to be used for forest inventory, management, and conservation. As the Canada Research Chair in Remote Sensing, he is exploring advanced forest inventory techniques to help sustain the forests of British Columbia with the use of lasers and optical remote-sensing imagery. In addition, Dr. Coops is investigating the application of remote-sensing imagery to computer visualization, to develop carbon accumulation modelling for greenhouse calculations, to assess wildfires, post-fire severity, and fuel hazard load mapping, and to detect insect damage using forest health indices. He believes his research will significantly benefit local and regional forestry communities and promote Canada as a leader in technologies that support national and international sustainability programs.

The good news is that the overall five-year relative survival rate has reached 62 per cent, and there are now more than 1 million cancer survivors in Canada. Unfortunately, surviving cancer often requires intensive and prolonged medical treatments that can last from several months to many years. These treatments can include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, hormone therapy and biologic therapy. Not surprisingly, cancer and its treatments can take a significant toll on the physical and emotional well-being of cancer survivors.Dr. Kerry Courneya, Canada Research Chair in Physical Activity and Cancer, is focusing on the role of physical activity in reducing the burden of cancer. Courneya is examining the effects of physical activity on health-related fitness, quality of life, treatment side effects and risk of recurrence in cancer survivors. Courneya is also developing behaviour change interventions to help cancer survivors increase their physical activity.Courneya’s research is changing the way exercise is viewed by cancer care professionals. Cancer survivors used to be advised to rest and take it easy as the best way to get through treatments and to recover. Now, thanks in part to Courneya’s research, cancer survivors are just as likely to hear their cancer care team say “don’t take cancer lying down!” "

The chromatin controls how, when, and where the cell's genetic information is used. How chromatin is modified in cancer cells is of particular interest to Canada Research Chair Dr. James Davie. He studies the mechanisms by which a cell transmits signals from its surface to the interior of its nucleus producing remodelling of the chromatin and alterations in gene expression. Scientists already know that certain signal transduction pathways are implicated in a significant percentage of human cancers and that these pathways are stimulated by oncoproteins that are involved in changing normal cells into cancer cells. Dr. Davie himself discovered that certain oncoproteins activate a signal transduction pathway in cancer cells that result in the activation of chromatin-modifying enzymes in the nucleus, leading to changes in the chromatin and expression of specific genes. Now, Dr. Davie is exploring the mechanisms regulating the location of these chromatin-modifying enzymes in the cell and the processes involved in regulating their activity and targeting specific genes. It has been found that by inhibiting the activity of those chromatin-modifying enzymes, called histone deacetylases, one can change the expression of a select set of genes that are important in the ability of cancer cells to multiply. Therefore, Dr. Davie is developing new strategies to arrest the activity of these enzymes and prevent the growth of cancer cells. Davie's research group is part of the Manitoba Breast Cancer Research Centre, which houses the Manitoba Breast Cancer Tumour Bank. Through studying proteins isolated from cell nuclei taken from cancerous and non-cancerous cells, these scientists believe that the identification of biomarkers in the early detection of breast cancer is an attainable goal.

The nature of these materials has profound implications for how they behave under stress produced during their production history and subsequent in-service life. Historically, however, engineers have generally ignored how the fundamental structure of the materials affects their behaviour under stress and instead only estimated their response. Canada Research Chair Dr. Mark Daymond studies the irregularities of engineering materials at the microscopic crystal level. Irregularities at this level can cause material deformation and failure, which in turn can lead to life-threatening situations such as the crash of an airplane. Dr. Daymond studies the behaviour of a wide variety of materials including non-conventional ""smart"" materials, such as the shape memory alloys that are responsible for ultra-bendable eye-glass frames, and piezoelectrics, the materials that produce an electric signal in response to pressure and which are only now entering mainstream structural engineering design. He recognizes that there is also much to learn about the behaviour of materials considered more conventional - such as steel and nickel - as we manipulate their structure at the nanometre (one millionth of a millimetre) scale. Dr. Daymond's research is having an impact both on the fundamental understanding of the material deformation itself and on the development of practical engineering techniques, new materials, and component design.

Her work integrates behavioural, neuroanatomical and molecular genetic approaches to study how executive functions can be modified by the environment, modulated by genetics and neurochemistry, or become derailed in certain disorders, and effective interventions and ways to prevent disorders. Her current research is changing our understanding of the prefrontal dopamine system and of gender differences in that, and affecting early education practices about the possibility of intervening early to improve executive functions to head off mental health and academic problems. Her work has shown that executive functions can be improved in very young children by regular teachers in normal classrooms without expensive equipment. Most recently, Diamond is turning her attention to the possible roles of play, the arts, dance, storytelling and physical activity in improving executive functions and academic and mental-health outcomes.

Superfluidity, condensation and evaporation, protein folding, molecular recognition, and self-assembly are all examples of properties or processes that are governed by weak intermolecular interactions. Canada Research Chair Dr. Wolfgang Jaeger is internationally recognized for his significant contributions to the characterization of intermolecular interactions. He and his team have shown particular expertise in the study of very weak polar systems, of ternary and quaternary clusters, and of very weakly bound helium atoms containing complexes. By pushing the boundaries of high-resolution spectroscopy into a cluster-size regime previously thought of as unreachable, Dr. Jaeger and his group have opened up a new research focus in the area between few-body and many-body interactions. The result has been an exciting interplay between theory and experiment that promises to provide insight into the microscopic evolution of this bulk-phase property. Dr. Jaeger is using state-of-the-art high-resolution spectroscopic techniques to study the intermolecular interactions of molecular aggregates, from small complexes that contain only a few molecules to large nano-clusters that consist of several thousand atoms. His explorations into the intermediate size regime emphasize the development of new experimental methods; they are also leading to collaborations with other theorists on the formulation of new theoretical treatments. This new research in the area of cluster science in the ""intermediate size regime"" promises to bridge the gap between microscopic scale and macroscopic scale properties. "

This unsustainable practice has provided the impetus to investigate molecular processes that occur in both healthy and diseased plants.Plants produce a vast array of bioproducts that have diverse roles in defending themselves against pests and pathogenic microbes. To counteract the plants’ defence reactions, successful plant pathogens also display an impressive chemical arsenal. Dr. Soledade Pedras, Canada Research Chair in Bioorganic and Agricultural Chemistry, is investigating the natural reactions of plants to pathogenic microbes to discover natural defence processes that can be used to protect plants. Pedras has discovered unique natural plant defenses that are harmful to pathogens as well as plant pathogens that have weapons that can strike back. She has discovered this “arms race” can be stopped with a new generation of environmentally-safer products called paldoxins that inhibit specific pathways in the pathogens. Pedras’ strategy could be applied to control several plant fungal diseases and to avoid the persistent use of fungicides on cultivated crops. Pedras’ research is leading to the discovery of compounds that mimic plant defenses and that will protect crops against microbial diseases. Her approach underscores the importance of preserving and protecting natural and agricultural ecosystems. It will also improve Canada's ability to deal with environmental problems posed by pesticide overuse. "

Changes in calcium channels can lead to illnesses such as migraine headache, epilepsy, hypertension, arrhythmias, and stroke. Neuroscientist Dr. Terry Snutch has long been studying calcium channels. Using molecular cloning techniques, he isolated five distinct classes of calcium channels. He then looked at the properties of the cloned channels to determine their functional and pharmacological characteristics as expressed in nerve, smooth muscle, and heart. In addition, he studied the modulation of calcium channels by intracellular signalling pathways and neurotransmitter receptors and found that certain physiological processes are influenced by the regulation of these channels, including increased hormone secretion, increased contractile force of muscle, and changes to both short- and long-term memory. Calcium channels are known to be targets for some therapeutic agents, including those used to treat epilepsy and psychosis. Dr. Snutch has described the structural relationship between therapeutic agents and individual types of calcium channels expressed in nerve cells. As Canada Research Chair in Biotechnology and Genomics - Neurobiology, Dr. Snutch continues his studies in this area. He is demonstrating how various types of calcium channels are regulated by enzymes and by intracellular molecules called G-proteins. His studies will show how painkiller molecules (both natural opioids and synthetic painkillers such as morphine) work. Ultimately, his research will provide invaluable information to help other scientists design new calcium channel therapies for conditions including stroke, migraine, and epilepsy. "

It is known that microfungi that degrade complex plant-derived and animal-derived polymers, such as cellulose and keratin, play key roles in nutrient cycling, the production of humus, and the health of forest ecosystems. Little is known, however, about the diversity of these microfungi or the effects of disturbing their communities.That's why the research of microbiologist Dr. Wendy Untereiner is so important. As the Canada Research Chair in Resource Management and the Environment, she studies the biodiversity of cellulose-degrading and keratin-degrading microfungi in forests, and explores how the abundance of forest microfungi and their species diversity correlate with the disturbance and the diversity of plants and animals. In her research, Dr. Untereiner focuses on the dung-inhabiting and soil-inhabiting ascomycetes, using these microfungi as indicators of ecosystem integrity. Employing both DNA sequence and classical techniques, she enumerates and characterizes the ascomycetes and tries to estimate their species diversity and numbers. She is also providing more comprehensive phylogenies (the lines of evolutionary development) for some of their groups. Given that only 5 percent of an estimated 1.5 million species of fungi have been discovered thus far, Dr. Untereiner's work is contributing greatly to our understanding of fungal biodiversity and it is helping to fill existing gaps in culture collections.Studies, such as these, provide vital information for the conservation and management of forest ecosystems.

Oddly, while some individuals are susceptible to infection, others seem naturally resistant. We know that the host's genetic makeup must play a role in such differences. If we could identify the ""natural"" resistance genes, we would have an entry point into molecular pathways that are activated to keep viruses at bay. This in turn would help us understand the interaction between host and pathogen and provide a basis for identifying specific therapeutic targets.Identifying these resistance genes is the goal of geneticist Dr. Silvia Vidal. She studies how the host's genetic background affects the risk of infection and severity of disease following exposure to two particular human pathogens: cytomegalovirus (CMV) and coxsackievirus type 3 (CVB3). Infections due to these viruses are ubiquitous. In immunocompromised people, they cause potentially fatal disease; in others, they are implicated in arteriosclerosis, myocarditis, and dilated cardiomyopathy. Therapies primarily interfere with viral replication; neither vaccines nor definitive cures exist for either infection.In 2001, Dr. Vidal identified an activating natural killer cell receptor gene as a major determinant of resistance to CMV. Owing to the gene's presence, natural killer cells can recognize and destroy CMV-infected cells. As a Canada Research Chair, Dr. Vidal continues to study the interaction between receptor and CMV, and between receptor and cellular components that participate in the killing of the infected cell. In addition, she is looking at the status of these receptors in immunocompromised patients presenting - or not - severe CMV-associated disease. She and her team have already localized additional genetic determinants of resistance to CMV and CVB3 infections that are being actively pursued for gene identification.

The region is also home to a sophisticated network of media artists exhibiting internationally. No comprehensive history and analysis of the art and industry of film and video currently exists for Atlantic Canada, which is on reason why Canada Research Chair Darrell Varga has taken up the project. Varga's research focuses on the relation between fine art practices and the development of regional culture industries. His critical and historical survey involves a close study of the interpretive meanings and cultural values of significant films and videos, while also examining the role of government and private sector institutions in the formation of regional industry. In Varga's study, regional culture is understood as being shaped by the overlapping influences of geographical locale and artistic impulse, as well as by national and global economic and political conditions. The practices of film and video production involve the large-scale organization of labour, technology, capital, and distribution - all of which reach beyond region and nation.

The deterioration of the environment over the past century, highlighted by water quality crises such as what occurred in Walkerton, Ontario, makes the discovery of quick and inexpensive sensors of such contaminant exposure highly critical. At present, we don't know a lot about the impacts pulse exposures of contaminants have on aquatic organisms. Nor is our method of monitoring water quality all it could be. Currently, we use static collection followed by water analysis, which results in significant delays that increase the risks to both the environment and human health. Canada Research Chair Dr. Douglas Holdway has taken up the challenges posed by these two issues. In his research into the impact of pulse exposures, he is carrying out comprehensive laboratory studies to investigate the effect of contaminants on the survival, growth, and reproduction of aquatic organisms in various life-stages and under a variety of environmental conditions. In his work to improve our ability to detect pulse exposure and its effects, Dr. Holdway is exploring the use of rapid biomarkers at the individual and molecular levels. In addition, he is developing ""real-time"" biosensors to detect contaminants such as fecal coliform and Giardia. Such rapid ""real-time"" sensors will be invaluable as metabolic markers of natural and drinking water pollution.The discoveries arising from Dr. Holdway's research are contributing to the reassessment of current environmental regulations concerning chemical usage and land-use practices involving agriculture and urban development. And the development of rapid ""real-time"" sensors of water pollution has enormous potential as social, environmental, and financial benefits for Canada. "

The Sun's stormy weather fascinates Canada Research Chair Dr. Jean-Pierre St.-Maurice. A physicist with a rich background in geophysics, and atmospheric and plasma sciences, Dr. St.-Maurice is studying the ionosphere over the Canadian Arctic. For his research, he is using PolarDARN, a new radar developed at the Institute of Space and Atmospheric Studies (ISAS), to measure the winds of the upper atmosphere and relate them to the energetic particles coming directly from the storms of the Sun. Dr. St.-Maurice is also studying small-scale structures and waves in the ionosphere (1- to 100-metre sizes), using a wide variety of theoretical, modelling, and observational tools such as radars and satellites.

The convention also highlighted the need for a deeper scientific understanding of the basic questions related to the loss of biodiversity. For example, are the unprecedented rates of species extinction impairing the functioning of natural ecosystems and diminishing their capacity to adapt to a changing environment? Can we develop measures to allay the effects of species extinction? These are the kinds of questions Canada Research Chair Andrew Gonzalez is trying to answer. He is focusing on Earth's most common moss species, Pleurozium schreberi. Believed to play a key role in the carbon and nitrogen cycling activity of the Earth's boreal ecosystems, P. schreberi takes centre stage - assisted by other microfauna and flora - in the miniature landscapes created by Dr. Gonzalez. In these natural models, Dr. Gonzalez induces patterns of species extinction among the inhabiting microrganisms that are similar to those which are occurring in ecosystems on a much larger scale. In the process, he is able to assess how biodiversity loss influences the ecological functioning of this micro-ecosystem. Then, by exposing the relatively species-poor ecosystem to conditions mimicking predicted climate change, he examines whether the loss of species diversity has altered the ecosystem's capacity to respond and adapt to a changing environment. Knowledge of the sort being gained by Dr. Gonzalez helps scientists acquire the basic theoretical understanding - and ultimately develop the technological tools - necessary to plan and implement the measures that will temper the effects of biodiversity loss on Earth's ecosystems.

However, because of all the data accumulated on the adverse effects of chemical compounds on the environment, societies are showing a marked preference for developing cost-effective ecological solutions. Success is indeed possible in this regard: biomaterials can be used to replace some chemicals and biotechnologies can help to reduce the actual use of chemicals, with due regard for safety, viability and productivity requirements. The implications of Rajeshwar Dayal Tyagi's research are significant. Residual biomass can be converted into safe, high-value-added products serving to reduce or minimize our dependence on chemical substances in agriculture, forestry and industry. Naturally, many companies are seeking safe, cost-effective solutions for recycling waste and are therefore interested in the development of the above-mentioned technologies, particularly since they can reduce both the costs of waste treatment management and the costs of producing biomaterials. Furthermore, the technological innovations concerned will enable Canadian industry to penetrate markets more successfully and open up new opportunities for professionals in the field, making Canada a leader in the use of waste water, sewage sludge and residual biomass for the purpose of creating high-value-added products.

In the heart, the pacemaker cells in the sinoatrial node set the heart's beating frequency. The cells also generate rhythmic, spontaneous electrical impulses that can control muscle activity, certain automatic functions such as breathing, and behavioural states including arousal from sleep. Inappropriate pacemaker activity may lead to both inherited and acquired cardiac arrhythmias, and may also be involved in various neurological disorders such as epilepsy. Canada Research Chair Dr. Eric Accili is the only scientist in Canada, and one of few in the world who focuses on ""pacemaker"" channels - the special membrane proteins found in the pacemaker cells of the heart and brain. Normally, positive ions flow through these channels and into the pacemaker cells, leading to repetitive activity. In the heart, the pacemaker channels are the targets for hormones such as adrenalin. Adrenalin released during anxiety or exercise causes more ions to flow through the channels, thus increasing the heart's beating frequency. In the brain, these channels are modified by neurotransmitters released by nerves, resulting in the modification of cellular pacemaker activity. People with rapid heart rate are often treated with drugs known as beta blockers. These drugs, in addition to reducing heart rate, however, often compromise the strength of the heartbeat, which under certain conditions can be dangerous. What are needed are drugs that specifically block the pacemaker channels and reduce heart rate without compromising the strength of the heart. Understanding the basic mechanisms of pacemaker channel modulation, therefore, is a necessary first step in the design of therapeutic drugs. "

The study of higher dimensional spaces, or spaces ""in the large,"" is aided by the presence of symmetry. The collection of all symmetries of a space has a simple algebraic structure: Two symmetries can be composed to yield a third, and to any symmetry there is an inverse symmetry. The fundamental mathematical concept behind this algebraic structure is the notion of a group, and the unchanging characteristic of a group that captures the essence of symmetry is group cohomology.Dr. Alejandro Adem is an expert in the computation and application of the cohomology of groups. Scientists classified the basic building blocks of finite group theory - the simple groups - in the latter part of the 20th century. The next step is to understand how they arise as groups of symmetries and how they can be used to construct key geometric objects, a context where group cohomology plays a central role.As the Canada Research Chair in Algebraic Topology and Group Cohomology, Dr. Adem is leading a group of scientists whose research focuses on fundamental questions related to geometry and symmetry, topics that underlie the mathematical structure of the natural sciences.

This capacity to change over time contributes to the emergence of drug resistance and even metastasis. In fact, if patients with micro-metastatic disease (cancers that spread to other sites in the body and form miniscule tumours) are not treated properly, it inevitably causes drug resistance, just as partially treated bacterial infections lead to antibiotic resistance. As Canada Research Chair in Molecular Oncology, Dr. Samuel Aparicio is trying to gain an understanding of the processes that underlie this behaviour by examining the clones of cells in cancer. He is focusing on hard-to-treat cancers such as triple-negative breast cancer and ovarian cancer and seeking to apply his finding to other cancers such as lung and pancreatic. Aparicio and his research team are taking two convergent approaches. In the first, they are combining genomics, and statistical and computational (article intelligence) approaches to examine clonal populations, with the aim of shedding light on the genetic factors responsible for drug resistance. At the same time, they are also generating small molecule compounds—precursors of drugs—to explore ways of stopping cancers from evolving. To do this, they are using information about genetic factors of resistance to engineer therapies that will avoid causing tumours to evolve. Ultimately, Aparicio hopes his research will help to identify drug-like molecules that have the potential to be developed as anti-cancer agents. "

To evaluate the efficacy of these molecules in fighting cancer and other diseases, they need to be built from simpler and more readily available structures, using synthetic organic chemistry technology.

They cost Canadians tremendously, both as individuals and as a society. Decades of efforts to understand these disorders have led to an understanding that both genetic and environmental factors contribute to the risk of developing them. Dr. Catherine Laprise, Canada Research Chair in Environment and Genetics of Respiratory Diseases and Allergy, is working to identify these factors and understand their impact. A key focus for Laprise is allergic asthma. To study it, she has recruited and evaluated families that have at least one asthmatic child and one other asthmatic family member. This approach is extremely valuable in genetic research because it involves a “founder” population. (In genetics, the founder effect concerns genetic variations that result when a small number of individuals from a larger population establish a new population.) This makes it easier to trace the genetic materials involved, since they are passed down from one generation to the next. Laprise is also interested in the variants associated with asthma and allergy that are harder to find (i.e., rare variants). Her findings will shed light on how environmental factors—such as breastfeeding, smoking, exposure to allergens, or work-related exposures—can prompt genes to manifest the disorder. By gaining a deeper understanding of the genetic and environmental factors that contribute to developing asthma and allergies, we may one day be able to predict the likelihood of these disorders, and prevent them. Ultimately, Laprise’s research will lead to new treatments and improve the quality of life for people living with respiratory disorders. "

He therefore plans to analyse at one and the same time the development of scientific disciplines and the transformation of universities between 1700 and 2000. This original, interdisciplinary approach will enable him to conduct, among other things, an analysis of recurrent issues such as the respective places of teaching and research in the university. The fact that universities are turning to private industry for funding is a source of much debate. Yet the phenomenon is not really that new: Louis Pasteur, the epitome of the disinterested researcher, made his groundbreaking discoveries in response to requests from the beer and wine industries. In fact, it was not until the period 1945-1975 that government funding for universities grew sufficiently for the number of university-industry partnerships to be reduced. The universities will play a crucial role in what is commonly referred to as the knowledge-based economy, and Yves Gingras's work will facilitate enlightened decision making on the future of these ""temples"" of knowledge.Professor Gingras, a researcher with an established reputation in Canada, the U.S., France and the U.K., is Director (2004-2007) of UQAM's Centre interuniversitaire de recherche sur la science et la technologie, one of Canada's leading centres for science and technology research.

The existing models, however, are not (yet) consistent with the fundamental physical laws of nature, and they are also plagued with serious conceptual problems.Canada Research Chair Dr. Brandenberger and his collaborators are working on the development of a new theory of the very early universe based on superstring theory, a quantum theory of all forces of nature.The new theory has the potential of explaining why there are precisely three large spatial dimensions. It may also be free of ""singularities,"" which are points in space-time where physical quantities are infinite, and where (therefore) the physical laws break down.An important aspect of the research is to determine whether thenew theory includes a period of cosmological inflation, or whether it will lead to the development of an alternative cosmology.The results of Professor Brandenberger's research will have profound implications for our understanding of the development of the early universe. It is hoped that the new theory will allow predictions which can be tested in future upcoming cosmological observations, and that it will permit us to probe the structure of the theory of fundamental forces.

Society must meet its present needs, while preserving the ability of future generations to meet theirs. Sustainable mineral resource development encompasses interrelated aspects of various technical, economic, environmental, and social/community issues, including those related to geology and mining, to commodity prices and market supply/demand, and to mine waste management and greenhouse effects. All these aspects are affected by uncertainty and risk. Canada Research Chair Dr Roussos Dimitrakopoulos considers risk analysis in mine planning, design, and production scheduling based on two modelling ""engines"": stochastic mathematical programming for mine optimization and stochastic modelling of orebodies. Stochastic means ""uncertain"" and here it signifies the ability of the models to integrate uncertainty in the form of equally probable scenarios. Thus, Dr. Dimitrakopoulos's models integrate multiple equally probable scenarios of the orebody being considered, of the metal price forecasts, of the mining possibilities, and of the environmental inputs. Technical issues and economic sustainability play a critical role in addressing mineral resource development under conditions of uncertainty and risk. The technical literature shows that in the 1990s, there was a staggering 73 percent failure in mining ventures in Canada and the United States - for technical reasons. The need to develop risk-based mineral resource development, optimization, and mine planning is paramount to Canada, where in recent years the value of mineral production has nearly doubled that of agriculture, forestry, and fisheries combined. Dr Dimitrakopoulos's research is drastically changing the way we now assess orebodies, plan and design mines, forecast production and manage waste, and plan mine rehabilitation.

That's why Canada Research Chair Dr. Kathy Hegadoren believes that gender is a key determinant in the risk of developing stress-related disorders and that we need to develop gender-specific early intervention strategies. In her research, Dr. Hegadoren is developing models that link trauma experience in women to a scientific understanding of the psychosocial and biological processes involved in their recovery or in their development of stress-related disorders. She carries out prospective psychological studies, brain imaging, and stress hormone studies with women who have experienced traumatic events. And, as a strategy for transferring this knowledge into clinical practice, she develops and tests clinical tools for use in hospital ERs to identify at-risk individuals. Dr. Hegadoren is also studying the longer-term impact of interpersonal trauma (sexual and physical abuse as a child or adult) on women's health particularly during pregnancy, childbirth, and early mothering experiences. In addition, and in collaboration with other researchers, she is trying to determine the influence a woman's reproductive cycle has on both her stress response and her response to antidepressant therapies. Together, the researchers are assessing the social supports available for women with postpartum depression, characterizing fatigue in major depression, and using a novel brain imaging technique to investigate the role of amino acid neurotransmitters in depression. Dr. Hegadoren hopes her work will produce intervention strategies that consider both the dynamic contexts of women's lives and the importance of the type of trauma to their responses to stressful life events.

Although impressive progress has been made in developing anti-viral drugs, most virus infections remain untreatable.Our immune system is our first line of defence against virus infection. Unfortunately, most viruses produce proteins that serve as very effective countermeasures. Canada Research Chair Dr. Jim Smiley is studying several such immune evasion proteins produced by the herpes simplex virus (HSV). HSV is a human pathogen that is capable of both rapid productive infections, which lead to destruction of the infected host cells, and latent infections where the viral genome is relatively silent, persisting in the neurons of sensory ganglia for many years. Dr. Smiley is focused on how HSV regulatory proteins function at the molecular level, and how cellular antiviral responses inhibit the replication of HSV and other viruses. The hope is that by understanding how these proteins work, he will learn how to block their action.Dr. Smiley is known within his field for the development of methods for manipulating large viral genomes, for delineating the mechanisms underlying site-specific DNA cleavage and viral genome segment inversion, viral gene expression, host shutoff, and for discovering that HSV triggers and then disarms the host interferon response. In his present research, he is particularly interested in HSV, not only because of its significance as a pathogen, but also because it (and other nuclear DNA viruses) offers powerful systems for dissecting basic cellular mechanisms. As well, the results of his research will allow the design of virus-based vectors as tools for human gene therapy. "

These sources are being depleted, however; they need to be used more efficiently - otherwise, how will Canada's future energy and petrochemical needs be met? More efficient utilization of Canada's non-renewable resources is a strong motivation for Canada Research Chair Dr. Jingli Luo. She is conducting research into new materials and new processes for developing alternative fuel cell systems that will overcome the limitations imposed on the use of fuel cell technologies by the high costs of fuel purification for conventional fuel cells.Canada's coal, heavy oil, and coke derived from processing Canada's hydrocarbon resources can be used for production of either H2 or syngas, which is a mixture of CO and H2. Both of these are vital for the production of transportation fuels and petrochemicals. Very pure H2 is also the fuel of choice for most conventional fuel cells. The cost of producing highly purified H2 from coal or coke is prohibitive, however. Thus, Dr. Luo is directing her research efforts at the development of fuel cells that use impure H2 or syngas as fuel, and at the manufacture of value-added chemicals. Dr. Luo is also interested in making sure that her new materials and processes are environmentally friendly. For example, her H2S-O2 fuel cell generates no greenhouse gases and simultaneously removes a toxic pollutant. In addition, she is also working on the development of fuel cells for converting alkanes (C2 to C5) to alkenes, because the production of chemicals in a fuel cell is both less expensive and less harmful to the environment.

On the one hand, the industry needs cost-effective separation and conversion processes to improve the value of oil sands-derived products for the public, and, on the other, the separation processes need to be in line with the Kyoto protocol in reducing greenhouse gas emissions of oil sands materials.The research being conducted by Dr. Steven Kuznicki offers solutions to these challenges. As a Canada Research Chair, Dr. Kuznicki is establishing a leading research group in nanostructured materials at the University of Alberta. Among the materials being studied are crystalline zeolites, which he believes are key to a cost effective separation and conversion processes.Crystalline zeolites are often called molecular sieves, because they are efficient agents in the processes of drying and purifying liquids and gases, abilities that serve as the basis for separation. They can do this because of their structure, which is sometimes compared to that of a sponge; they have a solid framework with interconnected cavities that are precisely the same size. Depending on the size of the openings to the cavities, zeolites can adsorb molecules readily, slowly, or not at all. Their ability to sort molecules can also be affected by the electrical charge or polarity of the molecules being sorted. Zeolites hold promise as new catalysts, new separation agents, as ceramic agents with unique properties and have potential as new types of semiconductors and optoelectronic materials. Dr. Kuznicki is using them to create innovative separation technologies, thus creating new opportunities for manufacturing, technology licensing, and exports for Canadian companies. "

Listeners can separate multiple sounds into distinct auditory images, store these images in memory, learn implicitly the way sounding objects behave, and learn the rules and patterns that govern the structuring of complex sound sequences, such as speech and music.Dr. Stephen McAdams explores the perception and understanding of this sonic realm, from the short sound of an impacted metal bar to a large-scale piece of orchestral music. As the Canada Research Chair in Music Perception and Cognition, he is extending his previous laboratory work on sound event and musical structure perception to more naturalistic settings that also involve listeners' other modalities, such as vision and action. Dr. McAdams explores sound source perception in complex environments that are real or artificially created by digital technologies. One of his goals is to understand more fully how humans grasp the sense of what is happening in the physical world by judiciously combining information from hearing, vision, and haptic (vibratory) senses during active behaviour.Dr. McAdams also studies the nature of the learning processes in auditory perception of sound sources and new musical grammars. In addition, he is interested in the dynamics of hearing in an ever-changing world. The human brain continually processes sensory information and interprets it on the fly, making use of knowledge that has been acquired through past experience. To study these dynamic processes, Dr. McAdams is developing new methods for measuring perception, emotional reaction and understanding in real time. "

Looking for ways to improve the stability and performance of international joint ventures is the chosen focus of Canada Research Chair Paul Beamish.Dr. Beamish is developing a comprehensive picture of the patterns and processes of cooperative behaviour of multinational enterprises. The majority of published research has considered only US-centric theories and findings. Dr. Beamish's research program is designed to provide a more nuanced understanding of internationalization by using a very large, longitudinal sample of Japanese firms. His research bridges current theoretical perspectives on multinational enterprises, financial economics, and inter-organizational networks.Dr. Beamish is also developing a dataset, derived through an in-depth survey of senior managers within three matched pairs of large multinational firms. This will allow a careful examination of the factors that influence the economic globalization of the world's largest enterprises. A second part of Dr. Beamish's research examines the impact of the multinational enterprise in society. Among the interdisciplinary topics under investigation are the effect of corruption on foreign investment and the relationship between poverty and foreign investment.Each example of new work on the impact of the multinational enterprise in society creates a bridge into a new group of scholars, be they ethicists, foreign aid policy makers, or sociologists. This allows for the creation of new research teams, thus encouraging a more complete understanding of these organizational forms. "

Canada's energy resources are traded in international markets, and the environmental consequences of energy production and use are often global in scope. In response, there is intense debate between environmentalists and the trade policy community over the environmental consequences of liberalized trade. Dr. Scott Taylor is providing answers to the two questions that stand at the core of the debate: What are the links between trade liberalization and environmental outcomes? And, do countries need to coordinate their environmental policy given that they are already involved in ongoing negotiations over trade policy through the World Trade Organization (WTO)?Overall, Taylor's research agenda is to find answers to these questions through the use of both theoretical and empirical methods. Theory is needed because the interaction of trade and the environment is complex and theory gives us a way to isolate and identify key transmission mechanisms. Empirical econometric work is needed because there will always be offsetting effects and the question of magnitudes will always arise. One type of empirical work that is of particular interest to Taylor is econometric analysis using secondary data on such things as trade flows, pollution abatement costs, emission levels, and/or ambient concentration of pollutants. A second type of empirical work is the use of laboratory experiments in economics concerning the impact of various trade and environmental agreements. Taylor's aim is to provide theoretical tools to help us understand this relationship and develop useful empirical tests to investigate the magnitude of key forces—tests that can then be implemented.

The number of marriages is declining, and they are more unstable—nearly one in two ending in divorce. Couples are increasingly choosing to live together and raise their children outside the confines of marriage. An ever-higher percentage of children go through the separation of their parents and experience complicated family histories in which each parent enters into a new union after separation. What are the effects of these changes on Canadians' lives? To answer this question, Dr. Céline Le Bourdais, an internationally respected demographer specializing in research on family change, plans to explore key stages in family life. Her work will be based on studies and surveys conducted in Canada, the United States and some European countries. These studies involved tracking individuals' lives as they evolved and make it possible to interpret the changes observed in light of the specific contexts.As chairholder, Le Bourdais will cover a variety of subjects, including the period of transition from adolescence to adulthood. She will try to document this key stage and determine to what extent the lengthening of the transition period is linked to the difficulties faced by young people in entering the workforce. She also wants to assess the degree to which greater marital instability affects children's lives. How many among them see their parents separate? How many will end up living in blended families and perhaps have to share family resources with half-sisters and half-brothers? How many will gradually lose contact with their fathers after the separation and will not receive any child support on a regular basis? All these situations need to be analyzed, measured and quantified before policies geared to the new family realities can be developed.To conduct her study, Le Bourdais will have to set up a full-fledged statistical research laboratory that will become a unique centre for training and exploration in family and social policy.

Drawing on periodical literature, medical accounts, advertisements, newspapers, patents, popular culture, oral histories, company records, and archival evidence, her research examines how minor tranquilizers have reoriented the way physicians interpret anxiety, and the way people experience anxiety.What social, economic and medical conditions enabled the drug Miltown, launched in 1955, to become the first psychological wonder drug in the western world? What do we make of studies showing that most users of tranquilizers are middle-class women? How has the popularity of tranquilizers transformed the practice of psychiatry as a profession? Why is it that, in the age of antidepressants, the bestselling psychotropic drug is not Prozac or Paxil, but the benzodiazepine drug Xanax, which is prescribed for anxiety disorders?By finding the answers to these and other related questions, Tone will provide us with new insights into medicine, psychiatry and anxiety. Her answers will also add to our understanding of the rise of the pharmaceutical industry in post-World War II society, the history of drugs and culture, and the experiences of ordinary people searching for tranquility during turbulent times.

Epidemiologist Dr. James Blanchard supports this goal by studying how communicable diseases, such as HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), spread in diverse populations, and why some communities are more at risk for non-communicable diseases, such as diabetes and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), than are others. In his studies of communicable disease, Dr. Blanchard is focused on preventing the spread of HIV/AIDS and other STIs in Karnataka and Rajasthan in India. More than four million people in India have been infected with HIV. Dr. Blanchard combines socio-demographic surveys with studies designed to understand the social and sexual networks through which HIV is transmitted in India. He is also examining existing prevention programs. In his studies of non-communicable diseases, Dr. Blanchard is focused on the epidemiology of diabetes mellitus and inflammatory bowel disease in Canada. Non-communicable diseases are responsible for the majority of preventable disability and death here, yet much needs to be learned about their causes and population distribution. Diabetes affects more than three percent of adult Canadians, but the prevalence of diabetes and its complications (such as kidney disease and vascular disease) are not evenly distributed throughout the country. Dr. Blanchard is studying its distribution and complications in order to design prevention programs. The second non-communicable disease that interests Dr. Blanchard is IBD (including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis), which affects more than 100,000 Canadians. He is analyzing health databases and conducting detailed surveys to understand IBD's distribution in Canada and to identify the individual characteristics that increase the risk of developing it. Dr. Blanchard hopes that his research on two continents will result in the development of effective public health programs for the prevention of disease and for the efficient allocation of health services.

An expert in aging and population health, Canada Research Chair Dr. Menec is examining factors that determine activity levels in older adults. Physical activity is credited for lowering rates of illness and reducing hospitalization caused by falls. But, despite the benefits, most people do not meet the recommended standard of at least 30 minutes of daily activity. This is especially true among seniors where physical activity continues to decline with age. That could be why in Manitoba individuals 65 or older incurred 59 percent of total inpatient hospital costs even though they make up only 13.5 percent of the population.In the initial phase of her research, Dr. Menec is using personal interviews and actigraphs (motion monitors) worn by participating seniors to examine how physical and non-physical social activities relate to chronic disease and the psychological well-being of older adults. Neighbourhood factors like crime and access to parks will also be studied to determine whether they promote or impede senior citizens' activity levels and psychological health. These studies set the stage for the evaluation of specific programs. Dr. Menec's research could lead to more effective programs to enhance seniors' health and lifestyles. The research results may also ease the strain on health care as Canada's population of seniors grows to a predicted 19 percent of the total population by 2021. "

Why is he focusing on the proteome? Because changes in the proteome are often associated with diseases. For example, an increase or decrease in the amounts of particular proteins in cells can cause debilitating effects which, in turn, can manifest themselves as disease symptoms. As well, diseases can cause chemical changes in proteins that make them work differently. The challenge is to develop technologies that will allow the identification and monitoring of the numerous changes in a proteome. Dr. Figeys and his group are developing microfluidic technologies to measure the level of proteins in minute amounts of biological samples.

The scattered x-rays, however, can be useful in identifying some tissue types, even cancer, and thus are of diagnostic value. Dr. Chapman believes that all x-rays should be detected and properly interpreted and the system he is building and testing at the synchrotron is designed to do just that. The system uses diffraction enhanced x-ray imaging (DEI), a relatively new technology that makes use of x-ray refraction and scattering as well as absorption to visualize tissues in unprecedented clarity and detail. Cancers can be seen with better clarity with this imaging technique while delivering x-ray doses that are less that 3 percent of what is delivered by present radiography. Experiments have shown that it can develop image contrast 33 times higher than can conventional mammography! One of the pioneers in the use of DEI, Dr. Chapman is perfecting this imaging method by merging it with the ability to detect and interpret scatter as the beam traverses specimens. The result is a more complete picture of the specimens, one that has many types of contrast or colours. "

Given that we know the benefits of an active lifestyle, it's ironic that physical inactivity is under-researched compared to the similarly risky problems of smoking and obesity. Canada Research Chair Dr. Lawrence Brawley is helping to fill this gap by investigating the kinds of social and behavioural changes that contribute to the ability of people to manage their own ""programs"" of physical activity. He also studies how people maintain physically active lifestyles over the long term. While most people know that being active is good for them, they often struggle with the changes in lifestyle that are necessary to accommodate an active lifestyle. Consequently, they may fail to stick with the changes and then pay dearly later.Individuals who make the changes successfully learn how often to be active, how to pace their efforts, and how to manage their physical activity so that it occurs regularly in their busy lives. While we can see that this success breeds confidence and persistence, we know little about how some individuals maintain the changes for years. This knowledge may be essential if we are to help people preserve the normal physical functioning they take for granted as they age, maintain weight loss, or manage chronic disease (such as arthritis and diabetes).In his research, Dr. Brawley explores different ways to help people change their behaviour and improve their ability to stick with the new behaviour. His interventions have already helped older adults with cardiovascular disease improve their physical function and quality of life. In the process, he has found that social factors (such as a person's dependence on health-care providers, or support by peers), as well as individual differences (such as a person's sex, or ability to solve social problems) can affect how the person responds to the intervention and influences its effectiveness. One of the challenges facing Dr. Brawley is whether his research interventions can be implemented at the community-level and in multiple municipalities. His Canada Research Chair is allowing him to build upon the promise shown in his interventions with older adults by using existing community-university collaborations to determine if intervention programs will work in the community.

",Do Genes Drive Social Networking?," Do Genes Drive Social Networking? The Social Network—the popular 2010 movie about how Facebook was created—touches on how technology can bring people together for work, entertainment, information sharing or dating. As the Canada Research Chair in Mechanisms and Features of Social Behaviour, Dr. Joel Levine studies how animals interact with each other in complex environments.in social networks that are similar to those enabled by tools like Facebook. By examining how fruit flies form social groups, Levine hopes to better understand how people interact in social settings. He believes fruit flies’ ability to form social networks helps them work, feed, fight, court, mate and lay eggs successfully. The idea is that individual flies are able to fit into groups, and being in these groups lets them interact more productively with the world around them. Levine and his research team are focusing on what drives fruit flies to form these social networks in the first place. Do they simply “get along” well? Or is it genetic? And, if genes predetermine how fruit flies will form social groups, and with whom, could the same be true for humans? In his research, Levine has used fruit flies to study how people’s internal biological clocks work. Since fruit flies share 75 per cent of the genes involved in many human diseases, such as Parkinson’s, Alzheimer’s and Huntingdon’s, he hopes they can also shed light on the genetic roots of human social interaction.

Rather, certain memory functions change as we age.For instance, our episodic memory (our memory of events and previously encountered stimuli) and working memory (our ability to hold and manipulate information for short periods of time) reduce with age. But most people do not experience a reduction in semantic memory (our memory of facts about the world and vocabulary) as they age. As the Canada Research Chair in Neurocognitive Aging, Dr. Cheryl Grady is examining age-related changes in memory, and studying why particular types of memory are more vulnerable than others. She measures brain activity during a wide variety of cognitive tasks, using neuroimaging techniques. Then, by comparing the brain activity with that of younger adults, Dr. Grady can see how the aging brain changes and adapts.As the age of our general population increases, so do challenges related to cognitive ability. Dr. Grady's research program offers insights into how to maximize memory functioning throughout the aging process. "

Tiny though they are, the cells in our bodies have remarkable power. How they interact with each other and respond to their environment determines everything about the state of our health. And when those cellular interactions - which are governed by signal transduction pathways—are disturbed, devastating disease can occur. Biochemist Liliana Attisano, Canada Research Chair in Signalling Networks in Cancer, is investigating two kinds of signalling pathways, those involving the transforming growth factor-beta (TGFß) superfamily and the Wnt family. TGFß superfamily members regulate cell growth, differentiation, motility, and apoptosis (programmed cell death), and they play important roles in normal physiological processes where coordinated proliferation and function of different cells are needed, such as during embryonic development, regeneration, and immune response. The Wnt proteins form a family of signalling molecules that regulate cell-to-cell interactions during embryogenesis. Failure of the TGFß signalling is involved in development of several diseases, such as cancer, as well as impaired wound healing, neurodegenerative conditions, and developmental disorders. The Wnt genes and Wnt signalling are also implicated in cancer. Using innovative molecular, cellular, and biochemical approaches—some of which take advantage of the latest robotics-based technologies—Dr. Attisano is clarifying the inner workings of the disturbed pathways in order to develop strategies for suppressing or enhancing the pathways to help fight disease.

They constrict and dilate in response to instruction from the brain and circulating hormones, and from their own internal communicators.

His work focuses on the heart and blood vessels. Dr. Floras was the first in this country to study the cardiovascular intranet directly in conscious humans, by recording from sympathetic nervous impulses that were generated by the brain and directed at blood vessels, causing them to constrict and raise blood pressure.He later used imaging methods to quantify the pumping action of the heart and the dilation and contraction of major arteries, and mathematical tools to discriminate between the accelerator and braking function of these nerves on the heart's pacemaker. In addition, he carried out calculations of organ exposure to the nerves' transmitters and took measurements of circulating hormones that regulate heart function and blood vessel tone.Dr. Floras's methods have been employed, in productive collaborations, to dismantle traditional barriers to interdisciplinary patient-oriented research and to uncover the mechanisms involved in cardiovascular disease.

Managers are interested in research to guide their practice, so there is a need to carry out research that matters to managers. For example, if workplaces are to be designed that contribute to the health and productivity of workers in the 21st century, managers need to know about all groups of workers, including those that have previously been neglected. Dr. Loughlin's research revolves around management's leadership role in workplace health, leadership training and development, and issues related to the workforce of the future. Research on women in leadership roles is notably lacking. Transformational leadership theory, for instance, is based on a measurement scale developed almost exclusively on men and simply assumed valid for women. And young workers have also been traditionally overlooked, despite the fact that they will soon constitute one third of the North American population, and will thus be a powerful force for change in the workplace. It is these types of gaps in management research that have led Dr. Loughlin to take on the development of new workplace models of leadership and health that represent all members of the workforce. "

This situation has limited the potential contributions of bioethicists to ethical policy-making. Dr. Françoise Baylis, Canada Research Chair in Bioethics and Philosophy, is developing new strategies that would allow bioethicists to make just and lasting policy contributions. She is testing the impact of these strategies on public policy challenges such as research involving humans, women’s health, public health, pandemic planning, novel technologies and access to health care. Baylis believes bioethicists need to take on greater advocacy roles and use their talents and expertise in pursuit of social justice. They need to exercise their moral imagination and find creative ways to make the powerful care about matters of fairness. That’s why she is developing strategies for bioethicists that are sensitive to real world policy-making and politics. Baylis is also developing effective means to engage people whose interests and voices have traditionally been marginalized in policy discussions. She aims to help bioethicists create welcoming places for meaningful ethics discourse beyond select interest groups. Baylis is doing this by exploring the role of bioethicists in creating spaces for deliberation and discussion.

The concept was initially restricted to that of the historic monument for purposes of national identity, aesthetics and prestige, but since then it has gradually expanded to embrace vernacular, industrial and modern products as well as urban and rural areas, sites, architectural ensembles, landscapes and neighbourhoods, particularly because of their symbolic, social, technological, environmental, economic and creative value. In short, the changing perception of cultural heritage and what it means has been marked over the last few decades by the fact that awareness and knowledge of the concept have expanded into both a holistic vision and a living culture focused more on the present and the future than on fragments of the past. In the context of this chair, Christina Cameron's work on built heritage will focus on the problem of the changing perception of the concept of cultural heritage and the contemporary meaning flowing from it and on the impact of the changes on heritage conservation, development and management processes. The study is organized around five main themes - development, ownership, awareness and use of built heritage - and will produce a number of benefits, including the following: it will foster interdisciplinary approaches, combine basic research and research-action initiatives, and factor in local and international situations. It will thus provide a particularly interesting context for conducting research, giving professional training, and raising awareness of Quebec, Canadian and world heritage. "

This transformation is known as globalization, characterized by the increasing cross-border flows of goods, finance, and people -- and the health benefits, and health risks accompanying such flows.The general view of globalization is that increasing trade and investment between rich and poor nations increases wealth and reduces poverty and eventually leads to better health for all. But this win-win theory isn't proving to be true for many developing countries. The deregulation of global financial markets recently led to one of the most dramatic economic collapses in living memory with health-negative effects being experienced first and worst by those people least responsible for the collapse. There is now little agreement about how to make globalization work for the poor and considerable concern about some of the damaging health effects of poorly-regulated global markets. Dr. Ronald Labonté, Canada Research Chair in Globalization and Health Equity, is providing new information about these concerns. His research in health worker migration, medical tourism, global health systems reforms, global health diplomacy and trade and human rights is providing important findings about how globalization can affect health. Labonté’s research will go a long way toward informing organizations and policy makers in Canada and abroad about what governments and citizens can do to maximize the potential health benefits of globalization while minimizing its health risks.

He acknowledges that globalization has a tremendous influence on society and the world economy. But he also believes it has important historical roots in past global empires, trade, migration and cultural encounters. Bender’s research examines how ordinary workers first became involved in the global economy, confronting, negotiating, representing and resisting globalization’s advance. As a labour historian, Bender looks for new connections and directions in how we study the lives of ordinary working people. His research focuses on a clear core question: how have ordinary people and their local communities experienced a globally connected world? Bender has already written three books on this question, examining it from different angles. Sweated Work, Weak Bodies: Anti-Sweatshop Campaigns and Language of Labor examined cultural debates about immigrant work. American Abyss: Savagery and Civilization in the Age of Industry introduced new questions about how American labour and industry relate to empire. And Animal Empire: Zoos and the American Exotic explores how Americans learned to look at faraway places, environments and people through the lens of animals.

Concerns about human health, environmental protection, and pesticide resistance are, however, modifying our attitudes towards pesticides and stimulating the use of alternatives. Today, a wide variety of horticultural crops and forest stands are being protected by the use of predators, parasites, and pathogenic organisms.

By shedding light on the Malagasy mystery, he hopes to help illuminate the early structure of trans-Indian Ocean World migration and commercial exchange.Dr. Campbell also plans to explore the history of the slave trade in the Indian Ocean World, revealing the changing structure, significance, and impact of slavery and the slave trade in the Indian Ocean World. Slavery studies have largely concentrated on the Greco-Roman world, and on plantations and mines in the Americas from 1500 to1860.

The emergence of drug-resistant parasites, increased globalization and travel, climatic changes, and the increasing incidence of HIV/amoebic co-infections all increase the frequency with which this infection is being imported to countries by travellers and immigrants. And, it is one of the major causes of traveller's diarrhea. It's clear we need to develop safer and more efficient control measures for treating amoebiasis wherever it is found.Canada Research Chair Dr. Kris Chadee is an expert immunoparasitologist, who is studying how E. histolytica interacts with the intestine and the factors that allow the parasite to invade the gut.

In addition to plant sterols, which have cholesterol lowering powers, Dr. Jones is working on several other functional food candidates such as alpha lipoic acid, known for its potent antioxidant properties, and n-3 fatty acids, known for their anti-inflammatory properties.By researching the properties of these and other acids, Dr. Jones is tapping into a host of potential health improvements ranging from reducing the risk of degenerative diseases and easing the lives of people living with Type 2 diabetes to reducing the incidence of certain forms of cancer as well as of autoimmune diseases such as lupus and arthritis.In the long run, as Canadians learn to include functional foods in their diets, they will become healthier and move away from a traditional medical model of health care to a more preventative one. With health-care costs increasing approximately seven percent annually, the potential savings is in the billions of dollars. "

Canada Research Chair Dr. Bozena Kaminska thinks she can help them with technology to monitor and connect them to the care they need. Dr. Kaminska has already developed a grain of rice sized wireless sensor for use in wildlife management. Now she is turning her attention to health care. Her aim is to provide an unobtrusive miniature device to measure health indicators such as heart rate and blood pressure and send this information by radio to computers and health providers for analysis. The response could be as simple as a recorded verbal reminder to take medication, or something lifesaving like the dispatch of an ambulance.Networks of miniature wireless sensors have many health-care applications, including diagnosis, monitoring, research, accident prevention, and clinical drug trials. Dr. Kaminska has set up companies in Montréal, Oregon, and California that commercialize wireless sensor systems to monitor everything from wild fish to airline food carts. Now she is building a multidisciplinary team of basic and applied scientists to create applications for wireless sensor networks.

From now until 2030, the energy mix will continue to be dominated by fossil resources. At the same time, the world's population will reach about 8 billion, and the demand for primary energy will double as a result. The global warming issue - and specifically the impact of greenhouse gas emissions from energy use - is so crucial that it could interfere with economic development. The economic impact could be particularly significant in Canada, which has huge reserves of non-conventional oil - estimates peg them at over 300 billion barrels of bituminous crude.In the near future, there should be a major breakthrough in the sustainable energy sector with the development of fossil fuel decarbonization and CO2 sequestration processes. For example, cycle-integrated, gasification-based bitumen decarbonization combined with CO2 capture would give Canada a sustainable energy strategy for preventing CO2 from being released into the atmosphere.In recent years, Faïçal Larachi has built a laboratory with a record of active research on energy and environmental processes and materials by focusing on oil and natural gas conversion and refining, wastewater treatment, and the reduction of atmospheric pollution. He has put his skills and knowledge to work in the engineering of multiphase, multifunctional reactors, heterogeneous catalysis, and non-intrusive instrumentation of oil spills.As chairholder, Dr. Larachi will be working with his team on developing new approaches and concepts concerning the decarbonization of the tar sands for the production of clean energy, the sequestration of greenhouse gases, the treatment of biorefractory wastewater, and digital modelling and simulation of related processes.

The objects represented might be people (e.g., job scheduling), buses (e.g., traffic scheduling), computers (e.g., interconnection networks), warehouses (e.g., facility location), etc. One of the main driving forces for research in graph theory is theoretical computer science, and some of the problems that Canada Research Chair Dr. Bojan Mohar is tackling in his research program have been motivated by their possible use in computer science.Dr. Mohar ranks among the leading discrete mathematicians in the world today, and his research at Simon Fraser University is providing world-class expertise to several groups and initiatives that use discrete mathematics as a research tool. Dr. Mohar has made significant advances in topological and algebraic graph theory, graph minors, and colourings (which in graph theory involve the assignment of colours to certain objects (e.g., vertices, edges, faces) in a graph). His research in graph theory is aimed at developing a new geometric theory of graph embeddings that can generalize and unify several of his former results but on a higher level. Embeddings is mathematical jargon for knots, the theoretical knots of knot theory in topology, which is a branch of mathematics that focuses on the study of topological spaces, structures that permit us to formalize concepts such as connectedness and continuity.

Ultimately, though, most of it ends up in landfills where it settles in for eternity. That’s because, since plastic is made of long chains of hydrogen and carbon, it never breaks down.Real solutions to real-world problems like these demand innovative chemistry. Dr. Douglas Stephan, Canada Research Chair in Inorganic Materials and Catalysis, is using his research to make these kinds of solutions possible. He pictures a future made of materials different from those used today. Stephan’s work focuses on creating new polymeric materials (things made up of substances that have a high molecular mass —like plastic, DNA or proteins) made of elements other than hydrogen and carbon. Phosphorous and boron, for example, might give useful properties to the resulting material—imagine a flame-retardant, plastic-like substance that can withstand heat, or a plastic bag that would biodegrade. Stephan is also interested in developing new processes that would improve the way existing materials are made. For example, hydrogenated oil is made by adding hydrogen to vegetable oil in the presence of a metal. The resulting product contains a small amount of health-damaging trans fats. If hydrogenated oils could be made differently, without using metals, the result might be something that contains all of the benefits of hydrogenated oil without the trans fats.Stephan’s work could be applied in countless areas, from drug manufacturing to perhaps, one day, making plastic-like bags that won’t last forever.

Decades of experimental work have revealed that the Universe is made up of fundamental particles called quarks and leptons. Although our current mathematical description of nature is spectacularly successful at describing experimental observations, it fails to answer many fundamental questions, such as: Why do these particles have the mass they have? Why is there more matter than antimatter?Researchers, such as Canada Research Chair Dr. Brigitte Vachon, hope to find answers to these and other related questions by studying matter under conditions that are much like those that existed a few billionths of a second after the birth of our universe. Such extreme conditions can be momentarily re-created in particle collisions of extreme violence.Dr. Vachon is particularly interested in the Top quark, the heaviest known fundamental particle to be produced during highest energy particle collisions. She is searching for a new production process that is predicted by the Standard Model of particle physics. Also known as Truth, the Top quark has peculiar properties - such as its unusually heavy mass - that provide unique experimental grounds for the testing of the current mathematical description of nature and where, perhaps, Dr. Vachon will discover hints of new physical phenomena.As a member of the DO international collaboration based at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory near Chicago, Dr. Vachon is contributing to the analysis of the large data set collected by the DO experiment and she is playing a lead role in the development of the electronic system designed to identify, in real-time, potentially interesting collision data.

Did it collapse from an enormous cloud of hydrogen gas shortly after the universe was created? Or did it build up slowly through the accretion of smaller gas clouds and dwarf galaxies? Trying to find an answer to this question is absorbing work for astronomer Dr. Kimberley Venn.One promising line of inquiry that she is following involves the study of the small, isolated dwarf galaxies that swarm around our Galaxy like bees. Dwarf galaxies, like our own Galaxy, have an impressive range of properties, such as mass, luminosity, star formation history, chemical evolution. In addition, they contain old stars; stars with ages as old as the universe. Stars preserve their chemistries from the gas cloud from which they were born, thus their chemical abundances are a perfectly preserved fossil record of the very early conditions in that system. If our Galaxy formed through the accretion of these smaller systems, then there should be a chemical signature to show this. As well, if our Galaxy did form primarily through accretion then this provides important evidence for the existence and nature of cold dark matter, thought to clump on small scales early in the universe, and now known to be the dominant form of matter in the universe.Determining the chemistries of the old stars in dwarf galaxies is now possible using the large 8- to 10-metre class telescopes and high efficiency spectrographs. As the Canada Research Chair in Exploration and Understanding of Space, Dr. Venn uses these telescopes and spectrographs to help her determine the chemical composition of old stars in dwarf spheroidal galaxies and young stars in dwarf irregular galaxies. Currently, comparisons of stars in dwarf galaxies with similar stars in our Galaxy show very little in common. The next generation of 30-metre telescopes and adaptive optics instrumentation, however, will make it possible to reach the old stars in the more isolated dwarf irregular galaxies for the first time, allowing us to firmly establish the links between the variety of dwarf galaxies and access their importance as building blocks of our Galaxy.

In order to serve as a barrier to these potentially noxious agents, the gut is equipped with its own mucosal immune system. These specialized cells are capable of ""tolerating"" the favourable bacterial flora and food antigens in our gut lumen, while at the same time as protecting us from the pathogens and noxious agents that could harm us. Unfortunately, the gut mucosal immune system is capable of turning against us, resulting in ""autoimmune"" disorders such as Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, and celiac disease. These immune-mediated chronic inflammatory bowel disorders affect a considerable percentage of the population, people of all ages and backgrounds, causing enormous suffering and disability.

Canada Research Chair Dr. Colin Chapman, however, believes that to advance our conservation efforts effectively we need to derive the appropriate guiding principles. Much of Dr. Chapman's past research has involved developing and testing models dealing with determinants of primate abundance, and attempting to predict how primates respond to disturbances caused by humans. Continuing his research on the endangered red colubus in Kibale National Park Uganda, he is now trying to determine how nutrition and parasitism operate synergistically to influence primate population size. In addition, Dr. Chapman is looking into the widespread hypothesis that changes wrought by human intervention bring non-human primates into closer contact both with each other and with humans, and that this in turn enhances transmission of microbes between species and the emergence of new diseases. Such transmissions can have dramatic effects as in the case of the Ebola virus, which is believed by some scientists to be the cause, at least in part, of the catastrophic decline in ape populations in Africa.This hypothesis, however, has never been formally tested, which is why the work being carried out by Dr. Chapman and his collaborators is so important. Using traditional methods from parasitology and exciting new genetic techniques, they are exploring both the role of disease in limiting primate numbers and how diseases ""jump"" from one species to the next.

They are thus vital components of electricity transportation infrastructures. Professor Fofana plans to demonstrate the benefits of using insulating liquids and mixes and developing devices for diagnosing, detecting and locating defects and signs of aging in equipment. He will have to conduct a number of studies to complete the proposed program. For example, he will use high-tech diagnostic tools (mainly optical, electrical and physicochemical tools) to identify and analyse the mechanisms underlying the emergence and progression of partial discharges and electrical tree structures that cause deterioration of electrical equipment. Because water plays a major role in the deterioration of liquid-filled equipment, Professor Fofana will evaluate filtration and drying processes, combining a variety of techniques for monitoring electrical equipment with a view to upgrading their efficiency. He will also foster the development of new products, including biodegradable liquids with proven insulating properties.By knowing more about the processes of aging and deterioration of equipment with insulating liquids and mixes, system operators will in a position to make appropriate decisions to avoid blackouts. Professor Fofana's research will result in innovative ways of upgrading the reliability of electricity supply and enhancing the security of transportation and distribution to users. "

The downside to this prosperity has been the release of persistent organic pollutants into the environment, some of which accumulate in humans and wildlife, especially in the Canadian Arctic. While certain of these chemicals are known to cause adverse effects, little is known about the rest.Ecotoxicologist Dr. John P. Giesy has become one of the world's leading authorities on how chemicals move in the environment and what effects they have on humans and wildlife. In the process, he has developed many of the analytical techniques that are now used to monitor chemicals the environment. As Canada Research Chair in Environmental Toxicology, Giesy is developing and applying methods for the identification and quantification of these chemicals, and determining, through the use of molecular biology and toxicology, the risks they pose to the humans, wildlife, and the environment. Perfluorinates (PFOS) are one group of chemicals being studied by Giesy. He is measuring their concentrations in the environment and trying to determine whether they are toxic. These chemicals are persistent and wide spread and their ""repellent"" nature has made them invaluable in the creation of compounds that go into making a range of useful products from microchips and fire-fighting foams to, most famously, 3M's Scotchgard fabric protector (now no longer being made). The dilemma for scientists is to assess the potential harm of such chemicals so that rational public policy decisions can be made to protect public health and the environment. Giesy sees his role as one that provides the techniques and knowledge that can help government and industry leaders make policy decisions that allow economic development and social empowerment without environmental degradation.

This is the question that motivates the research of Canada Research Chair Professor Patricia Lynne Howell, as she studies the three-dimensional structure of certain large molecules as well as the target protein's mechanisms of action. Identifying the geometry of the target proteins and their internal arrangement of atoms is a first step towards understanding how they act. Which parts of a target are required for its activity and where drugs bind to the target are key questions for scientists searching for new drugs to treat disease. Howell studies crystals that are made up the molecules in question and analyzes how they diffract the x-rays sent through them in a technique called x-ray crystallography. In addition, she applies various combinations of molecular biology and other techniques of spectral analysis in conjunction with simulation by computational methods in order to determine the structure and function of the target proteins. Knowledge about the particular proteins under study is furthering our understanding of antibiotics and antifungal agents as well as treatments for a variety of diseases including cystic fibrosis, circulatory shock, emphysema, and tropical diseases such as sleeping sickness.

Organic agriculture is a ""branded"" production system encoded within federal, provincial, and industry standards. Retail sales of organic food products on Canada have been experiencing rapid growth (more than 20 percent per year). Thanks to research being carried out by Canada Research Chair Dr. Derek Lynch and his team, the practice of organic agriculture in Canada will soon have more scientific backing. Imported products supply over 85 percent of the domestic market of organic food products in Canada. At the same time, however, large export markets for certified Canadian organic products exist in the US, Europe, and Japan. To meet these market opportunities, Canadian organic producers must develop strategies to farm both successfully and sustainably. Lynch has already made significant progress in examining crop and livestock systems characteristic of organic agriculture, with an emphasis on system productivity, resource use efficiency, and soil quality. In addition, he has contributed to the development of innovative nutrient and crop management practices tailored to organic production.In his present research, Lynch is continuing his work on crop and soil management practices that can help the growth of organic agriculture in Canada. As the organic industry grows, claims of benefits with respect to food safety, product quality, and environmental integrity are under increasing scrutiny, both nationally and internationally. While organic farmers face many of the same production challenges as other farmers, they must adopt a long-term, integrative approach to the special needs of their farming practice. With support from Lynch's multi-scale, on-farm, and station-based research program, they will be able to do just that. "

It basically refers to a pattern of economic and social advancement that ""meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs."" Governments around the world have formally agreed to promote sustainable development. But what does this really mean? In rich industrialized countries, such as Canada, it means we must radically reduce the burden that our societies are imposing on the global environment. To avoid catastrophic damage to global ecosystems, we must change the way we do things, particularly in relation to the major economic sectors of energy, construction, manufacturing, transport, and agriculture. Canada Research Chair Dr. James Meadowcroft studies reforming processes and structures of societal governance in order to promote this transition towards sustainability. His work is designed to draw lessons from international and domestic experiences, and to contribute to public debate and policy making for sustainable development in Canada. In his research, Meadowcroft compares the experiences of industrialized countries (such as Canada, the Netherlands, and the UK) as they engage in promoting sustainable development. In the process, he examines issues such as the integration of environment and economy in decision making, the provision of strategic leadership and planning, the relationships among different tiers of government, and how stakeholders and ordinary citizens are (and can be) involved in making choices for sustainability. As Meadowcroft explores what governments can do to encourage societies to produce and consume in more sustainable ways, he recognizes the vital role played by finance ministries in promoting sustainable development. These agencies provide advice to governments on taxing and spending, and they can exert a powerful influence to propel the ""greening"" of government operations. Technological innovation has a critical role to play as well. And public policy should be adapted to stimulate invention and the uptake of ""greener"" technologies. But Meadowcroft also insists that we consider the social side of production and consumption, and in this area he believes governments could do more to stimulate discussion about what we consume and why.

It is this desire to design more specific treatments for cancer that drives the research of Canada Research Chair Professor Michael Moran. Moran studies proteins, the pivotal regulators of biological life and death, encoded by genes. His work involves developing and applying advanced technologies that will lead to the discovery and characterization of activated proteins down to the level of their atomic structures.

The works of some writers do not receive the attention they deserve compared with the interest academics and literary critics in general show in the work of established writers. Professor Ouellet's goal is to gain recognition for novels that are no longer read and yet have value from a purely literary standpoint and should be better known.He will use a broad range of critical tools to meet the goals of his research program. He will analyse a number of novels from all angles, examining overall organization, narrative situations, modal structures, functions of characters, representations of speech and thought, figures of time and space, etc. He will also apply the theories of intertextuality and narrative semiotics. Literary psychoanalysis and the paternal metaphor will also play a central role in the program, which will focus primarily on French and Quebec works from the first half of the 20th century.By exploring the ""internal"" history of the novel, Professor Ouellet will endeavour to show that the value of recent literary history is relative rather than absolute.

As a Canada Research Chair, Bienzle works on the identification of the mechanisms of disease in cats that are infected with the feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) as a model for HIV infection and other animal lentiviral diseases. Lentiviruses cause persistent infections resulting in organ dysfunction and immunodeficiency. Bienzle is studying the host response to lentiviral infections, specifically in the context of FIV infection of cats. In particular, she is looking into the roles of dendritic cells (a type of white blood cell crucial for initiating immune responses) and macrophages (scavenger cells found in the bloodstream and tissues) in influencing the course of FIV infection.In another part of her research, Bienzle is trying to understand how horses that are exposed to indoor environments develop chronic inflammation of the lung. She is investigating the role of a specific protein (Clara cell secretory protein 10 or CC10) in airway inflammation of horses. CC10 is produced by specialized cells in the lung and has potent anti-inflammatory properties. Bienzle hypothesizes that in horses with chronic exposure to dusty indoor air, lung cells produce less CC10, which leads to persistent inflammation and the development of the asthma-like disease ""heaves.""

The goal is to slow, halt or even reverse the progression of knee OA. Knee OA involves a complex interplay between biomechanical and biological processes. There are currently no treatments known to slow disease progression—partly due to limitations in our available measurement techniques. Birmingham and his research team will use multiple approaches to develop and validate innovative biological, biomechanical and imaging methods to measure the progression of knee OA. The advanced technologies they develop will be integrated into clinical trials designed to evaluate proposed rehabilitative and surgical interventions.

Melanogaster Offers Hope for Alzheimer's and Ageing," D. Melanogaster Offers Hope for Alzheimer's and Ageing What are the genes that play a role in Alzheimer's? Currently, we know that mutations in three genes - amyloid protein precursor, presenilin 1, and presenilin 2 - account for almost 50 percent of early onset familial Alzheimer's. But that's less than five percent of the total number of Alzheimer's cases. Dr. Gabrielle Boulianne is trying to uncover the other genes associated with Alzheimer's. As the Canada Research Chair in Molecular and Developmental Biology, she is looking to Drosophila melanogaster, the fruit fly, as a model system to help her in her work.In addition, Bouliane is looking into ageing. While it is assumed that ageing and lifespan are influenced by genetic factors, the identity of these factors remains largely unknown. Boulianne has previously found that over-expression of a single gene, superoxide dismutase (SOD1), in the motorneurons of the Drosophila, increases the lifespan of normal fruit flies by up to 40 percent. This suggests that individual genes acting in specific cell types can have a profound effect on lifespan. Boulianne's goal is to use the powerful genetic methods available in the Drosophila model to identify genes that regulate ageing and determine the lifespan of an organism. Boulianne's studies are providing insights into the mechanisms underlying both Alzheimer's and ageing. More importantly, by identifying mammalian homologs of genes in the fly she may provide additional therapeutic targets for Alzheimer's. In addition, the genes that affect the lifespan of an organism could serve as targets for potential therapeutic manipulation of normal ageing and could themselves be responsible for genetic forms of pathological ageing.

There are many promising theoretical avenues, but they need further guidance from experiments and observations to construct the theories. Canada Research Chair Matt Dobbs draws on expertise in particle physics and cosmology to build and deploy new instrumentation that will provide measurements to help guide this theoretical quest.Gaining understanding about the birth of the universe is perhaps one of mankind's most intriguing quests. Very early in its history, the universe released a cosmic background radiation (CBR). Today this ""light"" exists at mm-wavelengths and forms a self-portrait of the early universe. Scientists have learned a great deal through the measurement of this radiation: It is the best evidence we have in support of a ""Big Bang."" And there is a wealth of information yet to be exploited. Most tantalizing is a measurement of the light's polarization, which is believed to carry information about the earliest moments of the universe's explosive birth. In his research, Dobbs is involved with the design, construction, and deployment of new experiments that have the sensitivity to make accurate measurements of this type of polarization for the first time.Dobbs is also studying another fundamental unknown, the nature of ""dark energy,"" which accounts for about 70 percent of the energy density in the universe, driving the universe to expand faster and faster. He is contributing to experiments that use a subtle distortion of the CBR from galaxy clusters, called the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect, to measure the expansion history of the universe and gain new insight into this powerful energy.Currently, our ability to identify these cosmic signatures is limited by the sensitivity of the instrumentation used in these experiments.

The realization that the same disease-fighting genes operate in both fruit flies and humans (and the fly's brief lifespan) has made the fruit fly a model system for genomic research par excellence and led to the establishment of a fly functional genomic facility led by Canada Research Chair Dr. Edan Foley.The innate immune system is the fundamental first line of defence against bacterial and viral infections for all multi-cellular organisms. Understanding how it works in flies furthers our understanding of normal defence processes within human immune systems. Foley has already generated a library, which allows rapid inactivation of all genes within the genome of D. melanogaster that have counterparts in humans. Using this library, he identified 121 genes that negatively or positively regulate fly immunity. Foley's fly functional genomic facility is the first of its kind in Canada. At this facility where complex biological events are measured within a short time, researchers inactivate each fly gene and measure individual gene contributions to innate immunity. They identify both the genes that contribute to normal immune responses as well as those that prevent immune responses from occurring. The technology they use is applicable to all areas of cell biology and offers new ways of examining important biological processes.Foley's research forms the basis for understanding auto-immune deficiencies and stopping harmful innate immune reactions and their findings can be applied to understanding the causes of various immune deficiency disorders including Crohn's disease, septic shock, cancer and viral infections.

The parasites range in size from single-cell protozoans, such as the malaria parasite, to metres-long tapeworms found in the gut. Those that have captured the interest of Canada Research Chair Professor Timothy Geary are ""filarial"" parasites, which can grow up to half a metre in length. An example of an infection caused by filarial parasites is elephantiasis, in which infected individuals develop grossly enlarged limbs.Filarial parasites are a kind of nematode or roundworm. They inhabit certain tissues, such as the skin or lymphatic vessels, of millions of people, somehow escaping immune detection and destruction. Geary studies how they evade detection; he believes that the answer may provide insights into selective immunosuppression - and offer new ways to limit parasitic infections in humans and animals.The major filarial infections of humans are sensitive to certain kinds of drugs that may act, at least in part, by exposing the parasite to the host's immune responses. Using proteomic and genomic technology, Geary examines how these drugs alter the host-parasite playing field. The tools allow him to identify molecules released by the parasite and study how the molecules affect the ability of host immune cells to ""see"" and attack the invader. At the same time, Geary analyzes the molecules that the host releases in its attempt to eliminate the parasite. The balance between the responses of the host and those of the parasite may be at least partly responsible for the pathology caused by the infection. By identifying the relevant molecules, Geary is taking the first step toward understanding how they work and how manipulating them might tilt the balance in favour of the host. "

Indigenous peoples around the globe are struggling for self-determination and a corresponding redefinition of their relationships with non-indigenous peoples and political institutions. Not surprisingly, they want to gain effective control over the policies and programs that affect their futures. Self-rule or autonomy involves more than the right to be consulted on matters of public policy. Communities with autonomy have the right to choose their own political leadership and decide what they govern; they have the right to engage in decision-making to determine their own laws, priorities, and policies. Such rights are still beyond the reach of most indigenous peoples, causing friction and strife between them and the state in which they live. Canada Research Chair Dr. Michael Murphy is providing a clear and compelling framework for justifying indigenous self-determination based on democratic theory.

Canada Research Chair Professor William Trimble studies how membrane fusion occurs in cell division and neurotransmission by focusing on the proteins that are involved in the process. He has already identified one protein, the prototype of a family of fusion proteins, which seems to be implicated. He is now searching for other proteins that regulate the function of the fusion proteins and has found that the septin proteins, from another family of proteins, have a role to play.Trimble uses a variety of molecular approaches in his research to clarify how septins are involved. So far, he and his colleagues have found that septins regulate transport out of the cell and this suggests that their function in cell division may be to mediate the fusion of membranes necessary for the division of cells as well. Trimble's discoveries have the potential of helping to define new therapeutic targets that will prove invaluable for the treatment of benign or cancerous cell growth as well as neurological disorders.

Dr. Christophe Caloz, Canada Research Chair in Electromagnetic Metamaterials, is exploring a host of novel related metamaterials. To increase the diversity and potential of these metamaterials, Caloz relies on physicomimetics (a process whereby metamaterials mimic existing physics while offering extra properties, thanks to their “tailorable” nature) and multi-scale/physics concepts (which involves adapting metamaterials to offer more benefits by combining them with millimetre-, micrometre-, nanometre-, molecular-, or atomic-scale substances that show useful physical properties on their own). This research requires a multidisciplinary approach, because it incorporates aspects of electromagnetics, optics, condensed matter physics, classical and quantum electrodynamics, material sciences, and chemistry. The devices and systems developed in Caloz’s laboratory are highly varied and have potential applications in many different fields. They include metasurfaces for tomorrow’s terahertz instrumentation and sensing systems; magnet-free nonreciprocal and highly sensitive nonlinear structures for next-generation electronic, terahertz and photonic sensors; antennas and wireless transmissions; phasers for real-time signal processing; and generalized space-time processors for myriad applications across the entire electromagnet spectrum.

Technological advances have also enabled scientists to test millions of variants at once in a single experiment, or even sequencing a person’s entire genome in just a few days. These advances have transformed our ability to identify the genetic variants that lead to rare single-gene disorders, as well as the variants behind the common diseases that result from multiple genetic and non-genetic risk factors. Dr. John Rioux, Canada Research Chair in Genetics and Genomic Medicine, has played a lead role in these discoveries. Now, Rioux and his research team are hoping to translate these important discoveries into better disease prevention and health care. By using state-of-the-art genetic and genomic technologies, they are trying to determine the role specific genes play in changing people’s risk of developing debilitating chronic inflammatory diseases, such as Crohn’s disease, multiple sclerosis and heart disease. By identifying novel targets for therapy—and developing tools to pinpoint individuals who will benefit the most from existing therapies—Rioux’s research could lead to a more personalized approach to treating chronic inflammatory diseases.

Diabetes is the leading cause of blindness, end-stage renal disease, peripheral neuropathy and non-traumatic amputations, and is a major risk factor for heart disease, stroke and birth defects. Diabetes reduces life expectancy by up to 10 yrs and profoundly impacts the quality of life of diabetics and their families. There is an urgent need to understand the mechanisms involved in the development of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and find novel strategies for prevention, treatment and cure of both type 1 diabetes (T1D) and T2D. Dr. Prentki's research program focuses on the molecular mechanisms of glucose regulated insulin secretion in health and T2D. His research is aimed at defining how beta-cells of obese individuals adapt to an excess lipid environment, and how under some circumstances they fail to adapt, resulting in diabetes. He is working on the identification of novel genes for T2D. He is also working to understand the factors involved in beta-cell differentiation and survival in order to advance the novel therapeutic approach of treating T1D through pancreatic islet transplantation and beta cell replacement. Dr. Prentki's research program is yielding information that can be used to design novel therapeutic drugs and methods of treatment for both T2D and T1D.The applications of this work include modification of our diet to help prevent T2D, inhibit the progression of T1D, and increase islet transplantation success for treating T1D.

Such methodologies range from experimental designs for unbiased collection of precise data to analysis methods for properly accounting for error/variation in the data in evaluating scientific hypotheses. Canada Research Chair Dr. Yutaka Yasui is carrying out research that involves the development and application of quantitative methods to ensure high accuracy and precision in health-related research. He is focusing on quantitative problems in two emerging areas of research. One area involves proteomic and genomic biomarker research for disease detection, prognosis assessment, and understanding treatment-response heterogeneity. And the other involves large population-based research on health and the environment. These areas represent emerging research opportunities that have been made possible by recent rapid developments in bio- and computer-technologies. Technological advances in genome sequencing, biochemical analytic instrumentation, and computing power, for example, have recently transformed biological research and molecular medicine so that researchers can understand entire complex systems rather than just individual elements. Although the basic principles of the relevant disciplines still apply, these new technological developments have brought methodological challenges in research along with new opportunities once previously unthinkable in public health and biomedical research. Yasui is collaborating with Dr. Phil Halloran, the Director of Alberta Transplant Institute, on the Genome Prairie Project's initiative: the Diagnostic Applications of Microarrays in Organ Transplantation project. The project is measuring high-dimensional gene expression data in organ transplant patients and exploring microarray-based detection and measurements of organ rejection mechanisms.

It has applications in many scientific fields including biology and medicine, the fields of interest of Dr. Qiyin Fang, who works on photonics-based technologies for biomedical applications. Optical techniques have revolutionized medicine with their potential to be used in all kinds of minimally invasive procedures. Lasers, for instance, allow surgeons more control and precision, and optical spectroscopy and imaging techniques provide diagnosticians with invaluable information that can be used to discriminate between malignant and healthy tissue. As a Canada Research Chair in Biophotonics, Fang develops techniques to use in diagnosing and treating a variety of diseases, including arteriosclerosis and brain cancer. For minimally invasive clinical diagnostic techniques, he uses florescence spectroscopy; for clinical therapy, he uses pulsed laser ablation. In the past, Fang and his colleagues developed a compact, mobile, clinical-compatible instrument capable of rapid acquisition of time-domain fluorescence spectra. Using this instrument, they studied various types of normal and malignant tissue in-vivo using both animal models and human subjects. In one of the applications, diagnostic signatures were discovered to identify brain tumour margin in real-time during resection surgery. In time, this instrument may be used to improve the prognosis of glioblastoma, a type of particular invasive brain tumour.As a Canada Research Chair Fang is continuing to expand his work in this field, developing instruments that can be used in clinical settings. He is also looking into imaging techniques that may be used in endoscopic applications to ""see"" the interior of hollow organs such as the colon, bladder, and stomach.

The applications of these computer-based techniques apply to a broad range of cutting-edge topics-from speech-recognition software to hastening the pharmaceutical development process. The current research of this new Canada Research Chair at the Université de Montréal focuses on ""learning algorithms,"" which are problem-solving methods that computers use to actively ""learn"" from received data.Along with a research team of a dozen students and postdoctoral fellows, Bengio will focus on two central problems. First, developing learning algorithms and techniques to deal with sets of data that contain numerous variables. And second, to create better learning algorithms for very large sets of data, with tens or hundreds of millions of pieces of information.The curse of dimensionality faces Bengio in those cases which involve numerous variables. The challenge is that in developing probability models, the number of possible combinations increases exponentially with the number of variables. It's a major hurdle for such applications as speech recognition, translation and information retrieval (e.g., Web search engines) software-cases in which the possible combinations of words to make up a sentence can run into multiples of a billion. Professor Bengio will design improved machine-learning techniques for these high-dimensional data sets. His research and development in this field will clearly have a significant impact on industries that rely on machine learning and complex computer software.This computer scientist will also create improved learning algorithms for ""mining"" large amounts of data. Professor Bengio will experiment with a variety of techniques to increase the learning algorithm speed for these large data sets. To accomplish this, he is working with corporate partners, including insurance companies. One of the goals here is to develop improved ways to determine the risk/premium ratio when setting insurance rates. "

And he should know, because he's in the molecular shape business. Branda's ""business"" revolves around the idea that the key to exerting control over a molecule's function is to have control over its structure. This control can be exercised by inducing reversible, ""on/off switch""-like changes in the molecule's structure; in other words, the molecule's structure becomes a ""molecular switch."" As Branda says, ""Only when we can control the structure can we control the function.""One of the most exciting applications of Branda's molecular switching idea is in the area of health sciences and medicine, where his switching technology may be used to help solve current drug delivery problems and create anti-cancer drugs with a functional activity that can be switched on and off at will. Molecular control can be applied to molecules found in other walks of life as well. For example, Branda's research has led to the engineering of organic molecules with switchable properties for the development of new and improved materials science technologies. One such development centres on photo-responsive, organic molecule-based electronic circuitry. Another focuses on the use of organic polymers for display and copying applications in information and communications technology. Branda is a member of 4D LABS, an SFU-based research centre dedicated to fast-tracking the design, synthesis, and commercialization of innovative functional materials with broad applications.

However, this achievement is only the first step in understanding how all these components work together to make a living being. It is the equivalent of knowing how to spell all the words in a book without understanding what any of them mean.Each gene encodes a protein — the working parts that perform the functions of life. Until recently no method existed to studying many proteins at one time. Technological advances in proteomics methods have now made it possible to probe entire systems simultaneously, rather than focusing on a single protein. As part of his research, Dr. Leonard Foster, Canada Research Chair in Quantitative Proteomics, is identifying disease resistance genes in bees and covering such topics as pathogen invasion, infection and the mapping of protein interactions. He is also learning how intracellular pathogens — microbes that make their home within the cells of our body — control the host and cause serious diseases like typhoid fever, malaria and tuberculosis. Foster is studying the interactions between these pathogens and our immune systems.Foster’s research on understanding how these pathogens break down our defences will lead to the development of better ways to fight them in the future.

Scientists have discovered that cells from boys with Barth's syndrome cannot properly remodel cardiolipin, the principal phospholipid in heart cells. Phospholipids are fatty compounds essential in maintaining the proper function of cellular membranes; cardiolipin remodelling, which involves the replacement of fatty acids on a cardiolipin molecule with different fatty acids, appear to keep heart cells healthy. Now scientists, like Canada Research Chair Dr. Grant Hatch, wonder whether the reduced ability to remodel cardiolipin may be at the heart of Barth's syndrome.Hatch is an expert in the field of cardiolipin remodelling in mammalian cells and his lab at the University of Manitoba is one of only a few in the world carrying out this kind of cardiolipin research. He and his colleagues are guided by the belief that their work may lead to new therapies to treat a range of diseases and disorders from Barth's syndrome to cancer. Currently, Professor Hatch is investigating the role played by a certain gene known as TAZ gene in the metabolism of cardiolipin by examining the phospholipid's regulation and expression in mouse cells. In addition, he is studying the molecular mechanisms in another genetic disorder in humans called congenital generalized lipodystrophy (CGL), which is characterized by a lack of body fat and a tendency to develop insulin resistance and diabetes. His research explores the role of mutations in a particular family of enzymes (called AGPATs) involved in the formation of cardiolipin, enzymes that also figure in the development of diabetes, cancer, atherosclerosis, and obesity.Hatch is also hard at work exploring the role of cardiolipin regulation in regulating heart cell death (aptosis); he is trying to figure out whether a cell's entrance into aptosis can be prevented or slowed by maintaining the molecular composition of cardiolipin. And, as if all this isn't enough, Hatch is also researching how cardiolipin is synthesized and remodelled during the cell cycle. "

It allows for the interpretation of life stories as texts while identifying their narrative meanings, patterns, emotions, silences, and distortions. High is especially interested in how oral history interviews relate to sudden transformative economic change, such as mill closings.Instead of working up transcripts of oral interviews (an outdated and time consuming process), this Canada Research Chair is developing new digital approaches to oral history. Much like a book index, the software on which he is collaborating digitizes, annotates, and indexes videotaped oral history collections, making them searchable and usable.

Even a temporary GI illness creates havoc, and chronic ones can have far reaching effects. Sadly, neither the causes nor the cures for some of the most insidious GI disorders, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), are yet known.While the personal costs of GI diseases may be difficult to quantify objectively, not so their impact on Canadian society; an apt illustration of this is that the treatment of GI illnesses represented 18 percent of Canada's health-care budget in 1997 - a staggering $8.7 billion! Canada Research Chair Dr. Derek McKay uses an integrated research strategy to explore the role played by various agents - known bacterial pathogens, non-noxious commensal bacterial species (that live inside us without harming us), bacteria-derived molecules, and activated immune cells - in the control of normal intestinal function and in gut disease and injury. He wants to uncover disease-causing mechanisms in the intestine in order to stop diseases from developing in the first place as well as to promote recovery and healing processes. For instance, in one aspect of his research, McKay uses an immune deviation strategy, in which precise knowledge of the immune processes that cause intestinal inflammation are used to enhance opposing immune reactions that block the pathophysiological reactions. By unravelling the cross-talk between cells of the intestine and the bacteria that reside there, McKay is making inroads into our understanding of complex disease processes, with the aim of finding better ways to treat functional and inflammatory diseases and cure IBD.

Few know better what this process entails than social anthropologist Dr. Ronald Niezen, who has worked with the Cree of James Bay and is well versed in Native American ethnohistory. As a Canada Research Chair, he is now studying how indigenous peoples have constructed politically distinctive identities that have shaped emerging patterns of transnational networking and cooperation, as well as political lobbying at multiple levels in international society.Niezen's work situates indigenous political distinctiveness in the context of a more general understanding of ""identity construction,"" which places particular emphasis on the dynamics of cooperation across cultural boundaries. The importance of these dynamics has been accentuated by the many new possibilities of communication and self-expression in the contemporary world.Through his research, Niezen shows how contemporary processes of cultural expression are helping those who represent indigenous peoples to articulate the objectives of their communities as well as to engage in honest and informed negotiations with their counterparts, the representatives of nation-states and the institutions of global governance. In this way, these representatives are able to promote truly viable programs of community-based development. Niezen's research program is enhancing the study of transnational political networking by turning our attention to the intercultural dynamics involved in identity formation.

Hypertension is also the leading cause of death and disease, including heart attacks and heart failure, according to statistics prepared by the World Health Organization.A state of high normal blood pressure or ""prehypertension"" is not only very common (occurring in up to 60 percent of adults), but is also associated with increased hospitalizations, admission to chronic care facilities, and mortality. Fifty percent of middle-aged, overweight or obese individuals with prehypertension go on to develop hypertension.Most patients with hypertension (95 percent) have what's called ""essential"" or primary hypertension, that is, elevated blood pressure with no known cause. One in five people with hypertensions also suffer from diabetes, and those with type 2 diabetes (the vast majority of diabetics) are hypertensive. In fact, diabetes is a vascular disease and controlling blood pressure has had much greater effect on the health of diabetics than controlling sugar levels. All this information makes it clear that we need to establish the mechanisms of vascular disease and blood pressure elevation in essential hypertension, and to develop new therapeutic agents to control blood pressure elevation and associated diseases.

For fish, the availability of dissolved oxygen is one of the most critical factors in their environment, limiting habitat quality, growth, and survival. Oxygen scarcity (hypoxia) occurs naturally in systems characterized by low light and low mixing (e.g., heavily vegetated swamps, flooded forests). Unfortunately, environmental degradation also elevates the occurrence of hypoxia, as municipal wastes accelerate the pollution of water bodies and fertilizer runoff adds excess nutrients, stimulating the growth of algae and nuisance plants (eutrophication) at the expense of other organisms. Thus it has become increasingly important to understand the consequences of low-oxygen for fish. In their studies of dense African swamps, Dr. Lauren Chapman and her research group have discovered how fish respond to extreme hypoxia and they have begun to explore the role of oxygen in the divergence of fish populations and the evolution of biological diversity. By comparing populations that cross oxygen gradients and by rearing fish under different oxygen conditions, the researchers have been able to detect changes in the morphology, physiology, and behaviour of fish in response to low-oxygen stress. They have also uncovered how alternative oxygen environments can contribute to faunal diversification. In addition, in their studies of the Lake Victoria basin, where the introduction of the predatory Nile perch coincided with the mass extinction of hundreds of fish species, they have demonstrated that oxygen-scarce wetlands serve as a suitable safe habitat for endangered fishes. As a Canada Research Chair, Dr. Chapman continues her study of conservation issues in East Africa, where two decades after the introduction of the Nile perch, some native species that were in retreat - or even thought to be extinct - are re-emerging. The impact of faunal collapse and recovery on resurging species is the focus of her studies. She hopes her work will help inform conservation and management initiatives and provide a deeper understanding of the role of hypoxic swamps in the generation, maintenance, loss, and recovery of aquatic biodiversity.

Canada Research Chair Dr. Philip Currie is fascinated with what has been unearthed in Alberta. A world-renowned expert on meat-eating dinosaurs, Currie has carried out extensive research on the anatomy, taxonomy, evolution, and behaviour of these creatures. His expeditions have led him to study the feathered dinosaurs of China, the king of carnivores of Argentina, and a pack of a dozen Albertosaurus from central Alberta's badlands. Currie's current work with University of Alberta's Systematics & Evolution Group represents the extension of his long-standing research program on the paleobiology of theropod dinosaurs. Theropods (meaning ""beast-footed"") are a group of two-legged dinosaurs that include the largest terrestrial dinosaurs to live on Earth. Although these carnivores make up only a small fraction of known dinosaur species, they are more significant than other dinosaurs in that they have living relatives (birds) and have attracted the most intense attention by other researchers and by the public. Adequate research and anatomical description of such specimens form a fundamental part of Currie's program because they provide a foundation for further studies on the relationships, evolution, biomechanics, growth, physiology, paleoecology, and behaviour of these dinosaurs. In addition, however, Currie and his students also use advanced tools and techniques (including CT-scanning for extracting three-dimensional data from specimens, and computer modelling to manipulate skull and skeletal systems of dinosaurs) in order to enhance their ability to test and study the biomechanics, growth, and physiology of dinosaurs and other extinct animals.

Experts in feminist theory, law, medicine, philosophy, political science, and sociology try of course, generally treating these issues according to his or her own discipline. But what is really needed, according to Canada Research Chair Dr. Cressida Heyes, is some interdisciplinary expertise and leadership that can coordinate and publicize these efforts, and thus paint a bigger picture of the emergent field of gender politics. Heyes studies the conceptual bases of popular and academic understandings of sexual difference, gender identity, and sexual orientation. Her work dovetails perfectly with the University of Alberta's pioneering role in interdisciplinary studies as she continues to develop the themes already alluded to in her SSHRC grant projects and her latest book. Her research interests include studying the difference between changing sex and changing race (""Why are there transsexuals but no transracials?"") as well as the feminist debates about freedom of choice regarding body modification, and an historical analysis and political critique of the psychiatric diagnosis of gender identity disorder.As part of her research, Hayes is developing an expertise in scholarship on social theorist, Michel Foucault (1926-1984; his later lectures on normalcy and mental illness are just being published). She plans to hold an international conference at the university, as well as edit or co-edit volumes of interdisciplinary essays on transsexuality, weight loss, and cosmetic surgery, inviting contributions from experts in Canada and abroad. In the course of her work, she is forging collaborative alliances within the health sciences - a perspective often lacking in feminist treatments of the above issues. This, in addition to her leadership in gender politics and feminist philosophy, is encouraging interdisciplinary research at the University of Alberta, while at the same time attracting and mentoring graduate and postdoctoral students and other scholars.

What they offer in particular are ways to study large numbers of proteins or metabolites present in a biological system. The process of identifying the proteins, protein modifications, and metabolites, however, can be extremely time consuming. Scientists need analytical technologies with increasing sensitivity, specificity and throughput. And this is where Canada Research Chair Dr. Liang Li's research comes into play.Li works in the area of analytical chemistry. He has a special interest in the development and applications of mass spectrometry (MS) for determining the proteome and metabolome - the way proteins and metabolites are expressed - in a given cell or tissue. (MS is a powerful instrument that helps scientists determine the composition and abundance of the atoms in of a molecule or its fragments.)Li's work has important applications in many areas of bioscience and biomedical research. MS can provide information, for example, on changes to the proteome and metabolome of cells grown under different conditions (such as a normal cell versus a diseased cell), thus helping us understand the biological functions of individual cellular components. In turn, this can assist the search for drug targets and drug candidates for more effective treatment and management of a disease. In his current research as a Canada Research Chair in Analytical Chemistry, Li is developing MS techniques and methods with increased detection sensitivity that allow researchers to identify and quantify hundreds and even thousands of proteins and metabolites from 10,000 cells, on a routine basis. His groundbreaking research is expected to result in the creation of several new analytical techniques as well as the discovery of new biomarkers for certain types of cancer, such as breast cancer.

He is studying Islamic law using the methods traditionally applied to secular legal systems. This approach removes the discussion of Islamic law from the more narrow theological religious values of Islam and places it squarely in the realm of comparative legal studies.Fadel is concentrating on the legal rules of Islamic law to demonstrate how they can be understood from the perspective of ordinary public policy concerns. He is also exploring the relationship between the legal systems of Islam and liberal democracies by using the fundamental similarities and differences between the two as a guide. His research is based on the premise that Islamic legal values are harmonious with contemporary views of law as vehicles for securing social prosperity and individual autonomy.Fadel's research will provide a framework in which citizens of liberal democracies—including policymakers in the executive, legislative and judicial branches of government—will be able to discuss issues involving Islamic law while minimizing entanglements in the theological views of individual citizens.

But few of us are aware of the many other possible uses of ultrasound. One such use is being explored by Canada Research Chair Kullervo Hynynen, who employs ultrasound to carry out surgery. Hynynen applies powerful ultrasound sources to generate local heating of biological tissue. By modifying the pressure wave and carefully focusing the ultrasound, he carries out a range of therapeutic tasks, such as occluding blood vessels, dissolving blood clots, and increasing the permeability of blood vessel walls and cell membranes. The focal energy delivery induces tissue coagulation within a few seconds without damaging the overlying or surrounding tissues.In his present research program, Hynynen continues to use ultrasound to develop non-invasive therapy and imaging systems. In the process, he hopes to increase the sensitivity, specificity, and speed of diagnosis as well as reduce the trauma and complications associated with treatments. His project includes the development of automated diagnostic methods (which won't require an experienced radiologist), so that the method can be made more available even in the absence of highly experienced staff.Ultimately, Hynynen hopes to create the means to transmit ultrasound energy transmission through an intact skull so as to offer additional treatment options to people with brain tumours, vascular irregularities, and other disorders of the central nervous system.

Treatment costs are in the billions and there are more cases of them every day. Airway inflammation is at the heart of both diseases, aggravating acute exacerbations and the more chronic structural changes that occur in association with them. Canada Research Chair Dr. Parameswaran Nair hopes that by studying the cellular mechanisms of both the acute and chronic conditions, he'll be assisting the development of better treatments. Scientists now use a reliable and relatively non-invasive method to measure the presence and nature of airway inflammation: they study the individual's sputum. Once the doctors have properly diagnosed the acute inflammatory processes, they can select an appropriate therapy. In his present research, Nair is advancing the development and clinical application of such non-invasive measurements, particularly in patients with difficult-to-control asthma and prednisone-dependent asthma. (Prednisone is a synthetic hormone that relieves inflammation and is used in the treatment of a variety of diseases including asthma.)The chronic changes in the airway wall from the aforementioned diseases largely involve the formation of scar tissue (extracellular matrix) and an increase in smooth muscle. Nair suspects that this accumulation of smooth muscle comes from the migration of smooth muscle. He is clarifying how this happens and in the process, investigating new therapies to diminish the deposition of smooth muscle and matrix that occurs in chronic airflow limitation. "

The contamination of drinking water by microbial pathogens is the most pressing water supply problem of our day. In Canada alone, over 20 percent of surface waters are contaminated with Giardia, which causes a diarrheal illness, and about five percent test positive for Cryptosporidium, the pathogen considered to be one of the greatest threats to our drinking water supply. Globally, illnesses due to waterborne pathogens are responsible for more deaths each year than AIDS and cancer combined. As the world's growing population puts greater demands on the available supply of quality drinking water, researchers are looking for better methods to protect water sources and treat degraded waters. In natural environments and engineered systems such as water treatment plants, one of the most important factors controlling the fate of microbial pathogens is their interaction with the surface of granular media or sediment grains. Canada Research Chair Dr. Nathalie Tufenkji studies these interactions under changing environmental conditions. She uses state-of-the-art instrumentation to measure the migration and attachment of different microorganisms to various surfaces of interest. By relating these microscopic measurements to macroscale laboratory experiments and then to field-scale observations, she is developing methods to predict the transport potential of these microbes in different environments.Tufenkji's research may end up playing a significant role in the medical and dental spheres as well, where scientists are concerned about microbe adhesion and are trying to find ways to prevent the formation of biofilm, the slime layer that develops when bacteria adhere to surfaces. By spanning a broad range of environmental and biomedical applications, Tufenkji's research is providing us with the knowledge base and the resources to help protect the quality of our drinking water supply.

It is a system that is widely acknowledged as socially responsible, and highly admired for its excellent quality. As with any system of health care, however, there are always improvements to be made and challenges to overcome. The current challenges are just that - challenges. Rising to them calls for ingenuity, innovative ideas, and Canada's traditional commitment to social justice, all of which are thankfully in plentiful supply. In addition, the government is on side with health-care delivery at the top of our federal and provincial agendas.Few people are as familiar with the problems that beset primary care in Canada - the foundation of our health-care system - as Canada Research Chair Dr. Ross Upshur, whose training in philosophy and the history of ideas, as well as in medicine, informed his seven years in rural primary care practice.He understands that fixing our primary care system has been hampered by such factors as a declining work force of front-line providers, diminished interest in the field (particularly among physicians), and a lack of properly trained researchers. In addition, he recognizes that reform efforts have been undermined by a lack of knowledge about how to go about change. To help overcome these and other related obstacles, Upshur has established a multidisciplinary research program that blends knowledge from epidemiology, ethics, and clinical medicine. He aims to fill the knowledge gap in how primary care professionals can provide the best care for many common chronic diseases, such as diabetes and osteoarthritis. By focusing attention on how these complex chronic diseases are handled in our health-care system, Upshur's research will help inform primary care reform initiatives, both nationally and internationally.

At the same time, globalization is having profoundly exclusionary effects.Canada Research Chair Frédéric Mégret analyzes how these exclusions operate and the extent to which they are a function of law itself, rather than simply a constraint of the environment within which law operates. To carry out his research, Mégret is focusing on case studies in which individuals or groups have consciously or unconsciously been excluded from protection under the law.One case study is about the exclusion of non-Western people during the 19th century from the protection of the laws of war. Mégret examines how this exclusion can help us better explain the current crisis of the laws of war in the context of the ""war against terrorism."" Another case study involves the United Nations and the reasons for its relatively slow response to demands for accountability from those negatively affected by its peace and governance operations.As he looks for ways in which the globalization of law might simultaneously be inclusive of minorities, Mégret explores how the international law of human rights has been affecting issues of social diversity. He asks important questions about international law such as: Can international human rights law reinvent itself as a law of social inclusion and, in the process, redraw the boundaries of political community and the nature of political association? Only a detailed study of how international human rights law is received domestically, such as this one being carried out by Mégret, can begin to make sense of these questions. "

Our ability to study and understand biological systems often depends on our ability to use special optical techniques to image and differentiate features in cells and tissue. Doctors use X-rays, for instance, to examine bone fractures or teeth through skin, they monitor fetal development with ultrasound imaging, and - with the advent of laser scanning confocal microscopy - they can see things as small as a cell nucleus. This latter type of microscopy provides sub-cellular resolution, depth-resolved images of specimens, something that is not possible with other imaging techniques. Such advanced optical techniques are the specialty of Canada Research Chair Dr. Daniel Côté. One of the goals of research in optical microscopy today is the development of new contrast mechanisms that allow the visualization of phenomena and entities that were not previously observable. Côté explores new optical techniques for use in tissue spectroscopy and neuronal activity imaging, both in vivo and in vitro. Tissue spectroscopy forms the cornerstone of our understanding in biomedical optics because it provides us with insight into the microscopic structure of tissues without destroying them. Neurons are the building blocks of the brain, and information that flows through them is constantly converted from electrical signals to chemical signals and vice-versa. Exactly how this conversion is done and how it leads to neuron remodelling is not yet well understood.Using minimally invasive optical microscopy techniques such as second harmonic imaging and coherent Raman imaging (which studies natural vibrations in molecules with light), Côté and his colleagues are able to monitor the electrical state of neurons as well as lipid vesicles (used for storing and releasing neurotransmitters), proteins, and ion concentrations.Côté's contribution to the development and application of these optical techniques is making a new generation of all-optical diagnostic devices possible as well as enabling new experiments in neuroscience aimed at understanding the fundamental dynamics of neurons.

The facts and figures are alarming: 240,000 Canadians chronically infected with hepatitis C, 56,000 Canadians infected with HIV, last spring SARS emerged as a threat, in the summer there were reports of West Nile disease, and by winter the news was full of bird influenza. It seems that everywhere we turn we hear about our vulnerability to viral disease.We can prevent viral diseases with vaccines, but what about treating them? For that, scientists are exploring gene therapy.One of those scientists is Dr. Christopher Richardson. Dr. Richardson recently published two therapeutic approaches involving genes that could lead to the treatment of chronic hepatitis C. The first method involves the design of a ""genetic smart bomb"" which targets and destroys liver cells that contain the virus. The second method involves the use of small pieces of RNA (siRNA) that specifically anneal to viral genomic RNA and lead to its degradation. This process of ""RNA interference"" has great potential in reducing virus loads in the liver.As a Canada Research Chair, Dr. Richardson is continuing his work in viral vaccinology and therapeutics. He has targeted hepatitis C, hepatitis B, SARS, and the measles-related Nipah virus for his studies. His research involves generating models for vaccine and antiviral testing, developing innovative gene therapy approaches for the treatment of persistent viral infections, and utilizing recombinant gene expression methods for the production of vaccine reagents. In his work, Dr. Richardson is manipulating the measles vaccine virus to incorporate the genes of other known pathogens (such as SARS, hepatitis B and C, and Nipah viruses) in order to produce multivalent vaccines. His attenuated measles virus vaccine has already been shown to have oncolytic (anti-cancer) properties and could be used to target a variety of cancers including multiple myeloma and B cell lymphomas.

Furthermore, with the exception of specific therapies developed as HIV inhibitors, there are very few antiviral agents to treat human viruses.The goal of the research being conducted by chairholder Guy Boivin, who enjoys an international reputation for his work on explaining the mechanisms underlying antiviral resistance, is to identify new viruses affecting humans and characterize the resulting clinical signs and symptoms. With this in mind, Dr. Boivin's team has built a unique diagnostic platform based on early detection of specific genetic sequences for most families of known and new viruses. One of the advantages of this approach is that it will reduce inappropriate use of antibiotics and slow down the growth of resistance to them.Dr. Boivin and his team are developing a new generation of antiviral drugs to fight viruses attacking the respiratory system and the liver. At the same time, team members are developing vaccines to prevent viral pneumonia and bronchitis in young children and old people.Viral (respiratory, intestinal, genital, etc.) infections are one of the leading causes of visits to doctors' offices and emergency departments.

These observations not only provide a unique model for studying the mechanisms underlying neuron development in the mature brain but also open up prospects for work on developing new treatments for traumas and neurodegenerative diseases. The success of these treatments will depend on how deep an understanding we gain of the molecular and cellular mechanisms that regulate the migration, differentiation, maturation, survival and integration of the cells in existing functional circuits and of the signals potentially being emitted by target tissues and influencing the above processes.The main goal of chairholder Armen Saghatelyan's research program is to identify and gain a clear understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms regulating the migration, differentiation, maturation, survival and functional integration of neuronal progenerators and controlling adult neurogenesis.

One group of these plants that is of particular interest to Canada Research Chair Susan Murch produces chemicals that can affect how our brains work. This type of medicinal plant has had a profound influence on human culture; some species within the group have been cultivated because of their capacity to change our moods, others because they contain toxins that impair our cognitive functions. The power of such plants rests on their inability to run away from danger; their sole protection against outside threat is to produce chemicals - more than 200,000 different chemical compounds of them - to survive. Detailed chemical analysis has been performed on only about one percent of the estimated 34,000 medicinal plants, but there is a growing awareness that neurochemicals (plant chemicals that work on the human nervous system) have important functions as regulatory and signalling molecules. This awareness has opened new opportunities for research in plant physiology and metabolism, opportunities that Murch is eager to grasp.Murch's interest in naturally occurring neurochemicals has lead her to the important discovery that the human neurohormone melatonin is present in high concentrations in medicinal plants that are used to treat neurological ailments. What does this mean? As yet there is no known role for melatonin in plant physiology.

This approach is timely as population growth is putting greater demand on water resources and industries such as pulp and paper and mining need improved wastewater technologies in the face of stricter environmental regulations. In addition, Chen is developing high-performance electrochemical biosensors based on nanomaterials for medical dialogistic and environmental monitoring.Chen’s research could lead to the use of electrochemical technologies in a number of environmentally-friendly applications, from water purification to renewable energy.

A Cleaner World Thanks to Clean Energy Systems A time will come when we'll be able to drive our cars, heat and light our homes, and power our myriad devices and appliances without contributing to pollution and green house gas emissions. That's the happy promise of clean energy systems based on fuel cell and hydrogen technologies. Fuel cells, like batteries, use electrochemical conversion to create energy. For fuel cells, the operation and performance depends on the flow of reactants (hydrogen, oxygen), heat, and current, together with electrochemical reactions. Because these processes are complex and difficult to observe experimentally, Dr. Nedjib Djilali has developed models that can accurately represent them, and, when combined with the methods of computational fluid dynamics (CFD), allow the unravelling of the some of the inner workings of fuel cells.As a Canada Research Chair, Djilali is pushing the boundaries of current knowledge of underlying phenomena involved in fuel cells. He is applying computational tools and supporting experiments to explore new processes and fuel cell concepts, particularly in conjunction with microscale structures. In addition, he is working on the development of predictive tools to assess hydrogen release and turbulent dispersion scenarios. Through his research, Djilali is contributing to the faster introduction of clean energy technologies by helping industrial partners reduce development cycles and costs of next generation fuel cell and hydrogen systems. His work, which explores new concepts that that can pave the way for innovative designs and operating modes, is also guiding the development of appropriate hydrogen safety standards. "

This country's cancer rates are staggering; the disease is non-discriminating. There seems to be nothing we can do about it.Of course that's not true. Behind the scenes, numerous cancer researchers - including Canada Research Chair Dr. David Waisman - are looking for ways to call a halt to this terrible disease and their discoveries and successes are accumulating.An expert in cancer progression, Waisman studies tumour growth, invasion, and metastasis, the leading cause of cancer death. He focuses on the conversion of a tumour from benign to malignant. This progression involves activation of a genetic program, which results in tumours invading the tissues and metastasis to other organs. Scientists have already identified two pivotal proteins as participants in the process. Waisman is now investigating how they work. Tumour growth also requires recruitment of a blood supply by the tumour. Again, scientists have identified a novel compound that blocks the development of a tumour's blood supply and Waisman is hard at work trying to identify how the compound's mechanism of action as well as the structural determinants responsible for its activity. Canada is fortunate to have scientists like Waisman on the case. "

",Better Ways to Communicate Risk," Better Ways to Communicate Risk When public health incidents like the H1N1 influenza make the headlines, effective communication between experts, decision makers and the public is essential to ensure everyone is well prepared to respond to the situation. The goal is to communicate risk in an appropriate fashion. Many lessons were learned from H1N1 that need to be incorporated into public health practice the next time something similar happens. Dr. Michelle Driedger, Canada Research Chair in Environment and Health Risk Communication, is examining how health risks are communicated in situations of uncertainty. These are situations in which experts do not have all the answers but policy decisions about health still have to be made to best protect the public. Driedger is examining the roles that trust and uncertainty play in how risks are communicated. She is also looking at how knowledge and evidence are translated from experts to other experts, decision-makers and the public. Measuring the success of health risk communication is a major challenge. Success is often measured by how many people adopted the recommendations that were provided. However, Driedger believes people should be given plain language information about health risks and recommendations so they can make decisions about what is best for them. That’s why her research involves accessing and learning from the perspectives of both decision-makers and community members. Driedger’s research will improve understanding of what does or does not work in risk communication so that conflicts are minimized among audiences the next time there’s a public health incident. "

For middle-aged and older Canadians, community involvement offers the opportunity to be more physically active. Dr. Maureen Ashe, Canada Research Chair in Community Mobility, is looking for ways to help older Canadians engage with other people in their communities in hopes of encouraging healthy aging. The aim is to support everyday activity within neighbourhoods and beyond. Specifically, Ashe and her research team are collaborating with partners such as older adults and health professionals to make physical activity more manageable to those with different levels of mobility. They are targeting key stages of life—such as retirement and the period after a health event (like a fracture)—as opportunities to promote behavioural changes that will increase activity. In partnership with key stakeholders they are developing a novel program to encourage and incorporate physical activity into daily life routines and to connect older people with their communities. Ashe’s findings may change the way we approach physical activity for older adults by reinforcing the notion that any and all activity supports health. It will also promote the integration of physical activity into daily life routines—with the ultimate goal of adding more life to later years. "

The most common arrhythmia is atrial fibrillation, whose prevalence is expected to double in the next 40 years. Not only does atrial fibrillation severely impair heart function, it also contributes to heart disease, the major cause of stroke. Unfortunately, looking to exercise as a way of preventing the disease often isn’t the answer. Although it provides enormous cardiovascular benefit, excessive exercise can also induce atrial fibrillation. Dr. Peter Backx, Canada Research Chair in Cardiovascular Biology, is aiming to tackle key questions surrounding the relationship between exercise and cardiovascular disease. Specifically, he and his research team are studying the molecular and genetic mechanisms behind how cardiovascular disease induces atrial fibrillation. Backx’s work has already uncovered molecular mechanisms that bring on atrial fibrillation. Now, he and his team will build on this past work to develop strategies for new treatment and prevention of atrial fibrillation, with a particular focus on the influences of exercise. To do this, they will use mice and atrial myocytes (or muscle cells) derived from human pluripotent stem cells (also known as human embryonic stem cells). The ultimate goal of Backx’s research is to shed light on the influence of exercise on cardiovascular disease and help identify promising new drug targets to treat it. "

As Canada Research Chair in Reconciling Relations for Health, Environments, and Communities, Dr. Heather Castleden is looking to other knowledge systems to help us mend the damage we have done. For example, Indigenous peoples have adapted to changes in their territories for thousands of years. Indigenous knowledge systems provide a deep understanding of how humans and the natural world are interconnected and interdependent. While this link between healthy lands and healthy people is coming to light in western science, it has been known, embodied and taught in Indigenous contexts for hundreds of generations. Castleden and her research teams are turning to Indigenous knowledge-holders for guidance on how to ask the right questions with respect to researching human health and environmental issues. The challenge is to bring these complementary, but different, knowledge systems together. Were it not for enduring colonial structures and relationships between Indigenous and settler peoples in Canada, this challenge might be easily overcome. So, Castleden is turning to the six “Rs”—respect, relevance, reciprocity, responsibility, relationality and reconciliation—for solutions.

But the rate at which they do so varies among species, populations and even from one individual to another. This process of channeling energy into useful functions is known as the metabolic rate. Although metabolic rate is critical to our everyday lives, we know little about the evolutionary processes that have shaped it. As Canada Research Chair in Functional Ecology, Dr. Vincent Careau is trying to answer this question. It is believed that metabolic rate varies as a result of co-adaptations with other ecologically relevant traits. Co-adaptation is a process in which traits interact to determine Darwinian fitness. In other words, it is possible that particular combinations of metabolic rate, performance, and behaviour may allow higher reproductive success. But until now, this possibility has remained largely untested. Careau and his research team are using concepts, tools and techniques from different disciplines to study trait correlations within individuals, among individuals, among populations, and among species.

For researchers who work in drug discovery, most new targets are proteins. Among them, G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the largest known family. In fact, data from the human genome project estimate that the GPCR super-family has more than 675 members and makes up more than two percent of the human genome. More than half of all prescription drugs target the GPCR super-family, highlighting the central role that these receptors play in treating or managing human disease. For example, certain GPCRs can control the activities of the neurons that are compromised in diseases like schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, Alzheimer's and Huntington's. Yet the potential for these receptors to serve as novel drug targets remains virtually untapped.

If understanding biodiversity distribution is in itself a challenge, predicting its response to global changes is an even bigger one. Understanding the impact of global changes on biodiversity requires adopting an approach that integrates several levels of organization. For that reason, it is important to call on concepts used in biogeography, community ecology and ecosystem functioning. Dr. Dominique Gravel, Canada Research Chair in Integrative Ecology, is a global leader in developing new ecosystem modelling tools. Gravel has shown that, despite the complexity of biological systems, there are some simple rules that allow for a better understanding of their organization and function. He is focusing on reconstructing the complex networks of interactions on a global scale, now and in the future. Ultimately, Gravel and his research team would like to develop a global model of ecosystem functioning. To do so, they are working with new design tools and implementing them via mathematical and computer models together with help from big data. This research will make it possible to produce biodiversity scenarios for the future—knowledge that is needed to protect biodiversity in Canada in a constantly changing environment. "

Nearly one in five women and one in 10 men report having been sexually abused in childhood. Sexual victimization in childhood is associated with a range of negative consequences in adulthood, and has a negative impact on victims’ physical and sexual health. Dr. Martine Hébert, Canada Research Chair in Interpersonal Traumas and Resilience, is interested not only in the impacts of such interpersonal violence, but also in why some children seem adapt positively despite the adversity. Analyzing the factors related to their resilience may offer strategies for intervention. Hébert and her research team are studying the development and diversity of children and young victims of interpersonal trauma. They are identifying protective factors that can influence individuals, families, societies and communities to reduce the impacts of sexual assault and violence in relationships. This will allow them to develop innovative approaches that can promote optimal development among young victims. Hébert is also implementing effective prevention practices to address interpersonal violence. Hébert's research will promote a more personalized and responsive approach that considers the diversity of the young victims of interpersonal trauma. Ultimately, her work will contribute to improving services for children and vulnerable young people in Canada. "

Today’s communication technologies rely especially heavily on light. These technologies are in large part based upon colour multiplexing and binary on/off coding inside optical fibres (Colour and binary refer to the wavelength and polarization of light, respectively.) But traditional information encoding and decoding schemes like these have drawbacks, such as a lack of data security. They have also reached their fundamental limits when it comes to carrying information. Dr. Ebrahim Karimi, Canada Research Chair in Structured Light, is trying to extend these limits. Karimi and his research team are designing and making novel optical and plasmonic devices that can structure single photons and optical beams. (Plasmonics is the study of how light and matter interact.) Since these devices can hold limitless amounts of information, they have the potential to offer solutions to the capacity limitations of conventional transmission techniques. By developing these devices, Karimi’s research will lead to a more efficient and compact way to structure light for applications such as quantum computation, quantum information, nano-sensing, and super-dense coding. Ultimately, these devices could open the door to developing ultra-secure communication schemes and ways of transmitting sensitive messages rapidly across the globe. "

It is when groups at the local level learn from each other and share their knowledge with other like-minded groups. Translocal learning can lead to change on a larger scale by allowing locally acting groups to maintain their unique culture and structure while nurturing global connections. Dr. Jonathan Langdon, Canada Research Chair in Sustainability and Social Change Leadership, is looking at how translocal learning spaces are effecting change. Translocal learning spaces contribute to sharing knowledge and building momentum for change. They can also offer local groups a way to connect with other movements facing similar challenges. Around the world, in cities and rural areas, people are working together to tackle the sustainability challenges that confront them. Yet their movements often seem isolated—especially when viewed in the context of the bigger threat of global climate change. As a dynamic and horizontal learning style, translocal learning contrasts starkly with the current lack of progress in climate change leadership at the global, multilateral level. Langdon and his research team hope that documenting this ongoing horizontal learning will help them understand how social movements learn from one another without losing sight of the particularities of their own struggles. Their findings will also help us understand how sustainability efforts at the local level can confront climate change and other complex challenges. "

But despite all the chaos and collision, these stories have led to a remarkable level of creative output over time. In fact, it seems that no matter how cultures interact, their relationships can spark many artists’ imaginations. Dr. Gerald McMaster, Canada Research Chair in Indigenous Visual Culture and Curatorial Practice, is investigating indigenous visual culture in the context of “contact zones” (areas where two or more cultures communicate and negotiate), cultural entanglement, voice and global indigeneity. Working with colleagues in Europe, South America and Australia, McMaster and his research team investigate how cultures influence and inspire one another artistically. His work also addresses the impacts of colonialism, modernity and globalization on the production of indigenous art, as well as how it is received by non-indigenous societies. McMaster and his team are focusing their research on three key areas: on indigenous Canadian artists who have represented European and Euro-Canadian or American newcomers visually or textually; on the creative developments of two isolated indigenous communities in Canada and Australia that differ historically, environmentally, and culturally, yet share political concerns; and on the tangled social and cultural histories of indigenous peoples and European outsiders in the Arctic and Amazon—two extreme and environmentally sensitive places that have demanded very specific human adaptations. Ultimately, McMaster’s work will lead to a new understanding of how relationships affect artistic expression among indigenous peoples in colonial contexts. "

Nevertheless, big data has become a fact of life that impacts all areas of society, including scientific research. Paul McNicholas, Canada Research Chair in Computational Statistics, is developing new, computationally intensive statistical methods to get a better insight into big, and otherwise complex, data. Some data sets have many measurements taken for each observation. While statisticians and computer scientists routinely deal with data that can contain hundreds or thousands of variables, modern data sets often have upwards of ten thousand variables. Unfortunately, there is a lack of effective methodology for this so-called “ultra high-dimensional” data. McNicholas is combining expertise in computing and statistics to develop computational statistics approaches for this type of data. He will focus on methods that find subgroups of similar observations and are applicable in any setting where ultra high-dimensional data exists—from management science to disease diagnostics and bioinformatics. McNicholas is also developing computational statistics methods that will allow users to make sense of massive data sets with measurements of different types. Similar to his work on ultra high-dimensional data, this work promises to simplify and facilitate data analytics in many fields of social, economic, and scientific endeavour. McNicholas’ research will help create statistical approaches to data that can: look for subtypes of certain cancers; help identify candidate genes for modification to allow food crops to grow in developing countries; and combine genetic, fitness, and other health data to study the relationship between obesity, genes, nutrition, and exercise.

Lack of oxygen, or hypoxia, is a factor in several of the leading causes of death in Canada, including cardiac diseases, respiratory diseases and stroke. Most research into what causes these diseases is performed on mice and rats. But these animals, like humans, are intolerant of hypoxia—so researchers can only use them to search for ways to repair damage after the fact. As Canada Research Chair in Comparative Neurophysiology, Dr. Matthew Pamenter is looking for a new, more proactive approach to studying hypoxia. He and his research team are studying hypoxia-tolerant species—such as naked mole rats—that have lived in hypoxic (low-oxygen) environments for thousands of years. This approach allows Pamenter and his team to identify the strategies these animals have developed over time to protect themselves from the damage caused by low-oxygen environments. It is also a first step in identifying possible ways to prevent damage caused by hypoxia before it occurs. By studying extremely hypoxia-tolerant mammals, Pamenter and his team are hoping to better understand the mechanisms that naturally protect the brain, heart and whole organisms against the damaging effects of hypoxia. Their goal is to learn how some species have evolved to adapt to oxygen deficiency. This knowledge could lead to new strategies and therapies to treat diseases related to hypoxia. "

We have long known that hydrocarbons and fuel additives are dangerous. But as Canada Research Chair in Environmental Engineering and Stable Isotopes, Dr. Elodie Passeport is interested in a newer class of pollutants called “emerging contaminants”—substances like pesticides, drugs and personal care products, which enter our waterways through human activity. The first step in addressing this problem is understanding more about how these emerging contaminants behave and degrade. But past research methods have had drawbacks. For example, studies could measure the concentrations of contaminants going into and out of constructed wetlands (which act as filters), but could not distinguish how they were removed or whether they were merely displaced—such as when waterborne contaminants are retained in the soil. Passeport and her research team will tackle this problem using a technique called compound-specific isotope analysis, which will allow them to investigate the balance between permanent and temporary contaminant removal in passive water treatment systems, such as constructed wetlands. By using this technique, they will also be able to analyze environmental samples to get information about contaminant sources and the extent of degradation. Passeport’s research will give us a better understanding of what happens to contaminants in the environment and in constructed wetlands—and may ultimately lead to better passive water treatment technologies to protect human health and the environment.

This makes them indispensable to life—and when they malfunction, it can lead to illnesses as diverse as neurodegenerative diseases, cancers and heart diseases. Understanding the diversity of proteins and how they work is therefore a key objective for scientific and medical research. Proteins are expressed via genetic messages or messenger RNA (ribonucleic acid), which are produced from genes. Contrary to what was once thought, messenger RNA contains not just one, but several messages for several different proteins. The number of messages on each messenger RNA, and in turn the number of proteins produced by the cells, has been greatly underestimated. As Canada Research Chair in Functional Proteomics and Discovery of New Protein, Dr. Xavier Roucou has developed tools to detect these new proteins and determine their functions. Roucou and his research team use an interdisciplinary approach that marries proteomics, biochemistry, cellular biology, bioinformatics and structural biology. Roucou’s research on the discovery of new proteins has been eye-opening on an aspect of the cell that is entirely new. His results will make it easier to understand the cell’s molecular mechanisms in both normal and disease conditions.

The costs associated with certain diseases affecting the elderly are constantly increasing, and have grown into billions of dollars. When a patient is treated for a disease or an accident, whether in a hospital, a specialized clinic or at home, a collection of resources, both human (physicians, nurses, administrative staff) and material (exam rooms, diagnostic material, surgical rooms, and so on) must be coordinated. Planning all of these resources in a silo, as we currently do, leads to significant delays in treating many patients and increases system costs. As Canada Research Chair in Analytics and Logistics in Healthcare, Dr. Louis-Martin Rousseau aims to improve how we plan and deliver health care.

They can lead to depression, anxiety and even cognitive decline. In noisy environments, like a restaurant, a party or even a busy street, our brains have the difficult task of blocking out background noise to isolate and understand speech. As we age, understanding speech in these noisy environments becomes increasingly difficult. Dr. Benjamin Zendel, Canada Research Chair in Aging and Auditory Neuroscience, is working to improve hearing abilities in older adults. He will accomplish this by investigating the impact of age on how the brain processes both speech and music. Zendel’s past research demonstrated that older people who are lifelong musicians are better at understanding speech in background noise compared to non-musicians. In fact, he found that the average 70-year-old musician can understand speech in a noisy environment just as well as the average 50-year-old non-musician. Now, he and his research team are looking to translate this finding into knowledge that can benefit all Canadians. They are working to determine if there is a causal link between musical training and better hearing in older adults. To do this, Zendel and his team are using electroencephalography (EEG) to identify neural functions related to processing speech and music. At the same time, they are trying to determine which components of musical training lead people to be better at processing both speech and music. By better understanding the link between musical training and hearing, Zendel hopes to provide a foundation to develop auditory rehabilitation programs that will improve older people’s hearing and help promote healthy aging.

We know that about a third of all fish stocks are overfished—and most countries agree that overfishing is biologically, socially, and economically wasteful. So why does overfishing persist? Dr. Megan Bailey, Canada Research Chair in Integrated Ocean and Coastal Governance, is looking for answers to this question. At the heart of her research is the search for a way to combine insights from both the producers and consumers of seafood. Countries generally try to oversee fisheries production, while the job of influencing the consumption of seafood is left largely to non-governmental organizations (NGOs). This split leaves a vacuum when it comes to combining information from both ends of the value chain to measure conservation gains. Bailey’s work focuses on understanding how information gained by linking fisheries producers and consumers can help countries—the legal stewards of our oceans—to cooperate more effectively in overseeing the world’s oceans. Seafood value chains are global and complex, so Bailey works with partners in Canada, the United States, Europe, Indonesia, the Philippines, Fiji, Vietnam, and Australia to promote cooperation in overseeing fisheries through greater understanding of the roles played by governments, NGOs, and consumers in the sustainable seafood movement. By analyzing trends in sustainable seafood governance—such as improved regional management, fisheries improvement projects, and movements towards traceability (the ability to follow movements in the fisheries supply chain)—Bailey’s work offers insights into how we can do a better job governing ocean and coastal resources.

But the incidence of kidney stones is increasing among the general population—and having one episode significantly increases the odds of having another. Kidney stones are just one example of a disorder caused by changes in how ions are transported across renal epithelia. Epithelial cells are those that line some of our organs and glands, helping to protect and enclose them. Renal epithelia are essential to proper kidney function. Dr. Todd Alexander, Canada Research Chair in Renal Epithelial Transport Physiology, aims to understand how—in the process of cleaning the blood—the kidneys hold on to important electrolytes, such as sodium, bicarbonate and calcium. Abnormalities in the way some people hold on to these electrolytes result in common disorders, such as kidney stones, high blood pressure and osteoporosis. Alexander and his research team are focusing on the main transport mechanisms by which renal tubules (essential structures in the kidneys) regulate the body’s electrolyte and fluid balance. In particular, they want to understand how changes in the way calcium is transported lead to the development of kidney stones and other diseases, such as osteoporosis. They are also investigating why in some cases, the kidneys absorb increased sodium, resulting in hypertension. Alexander hopes that by better understanding these fundamental kidney processes, researchers can develop new and improved therapies to treat disorders like kidney stones, osteoporosis and high blood pressure.

Ana Andreazza, Canada Research Chair in Molecular Pharmacology of Mood Disorders, is an emerging international leader in this field, which is searching for affordable, easy-to-use and clinically relevant biological markers that can be used for biological confirmation of a mood disorder diagnosis, or to identify people at risk of developing a mood disorder. The identification of biological targets will open doors to the development of new treatment strategies that treat abnormalities or impairments in oxidation processes in the periphery that contribute to mood disorders. Her research, in collaboration with other laboratories, has produced some of the most convincing insights to date into the mechanisms that underlie mood disorders by focusing on metabolic processes known as oxidation and reduction reactions or redox modulations. Andreazza is currently furthering her study of the role these redox abnormalities or impairments play in mood disorders, and is exploring the possible effects of redox modulations on molecular pathways leading to synaptic alterations, particularly those that might provide potential avenues for therapy. She is also investigating the role these redox mistakes and inflammation play in signalling white matter changes in mood disorder. Her research has led to treatments with antioxidants that have shown promising results when used with other therapies, opening up exciting new treatment possibilities and hope for people with mood disorders.

Over the past 30 years, MRI has let us peer inside the living body and examine and measure brain structure, function and metabolism. However, the brain damage we can see using standard MRI may be just the tip of the iceberg in many neurological disorders. Engineering and scientific advances in hardware, as well as the development of novel imaging methods, have led to vastly improved MRI technology. These better images can show tissue abnormalities that would not be detected using standard MRI. As Canada Research Chair in MRI of Brain Micro-structure, Dr. Christian Beaulieu will drive the next generation of technologies to detect and quantify micro-structural features in the brain that cannot currently be measured with MRI. He and his research team aim to reveal “invisible” injuries through images that will reflect a disease’s overall impact more precisely and thoroughly. Working with clinical researchers, Beaulieu will test imaging innovations on patients with stroke, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis and neurodevelopment disorders. He will also test the same imaging innovations on healthy people at different ages for comparison, in order to understand what is typical before identifying what is wrong. By supporting advances in MRI technology, Beaulieu’s research will help unravel the mysteries of many brain disorders. It will also improve our ability to diagnose and treat patients, and make the best possible use of new, powerful tools in health care. "

How are musical experiences connected to other parts of culture and society? These are the questions that ethnomusicology—the study of music in its cultural context—aims to address. For more than 100 years, ethnomusicology scholars have been working in communities to understand the meaning of musical traditions for the people who make and listen to the music. The scholars’ work has been aimed at interpreting the meaning of the musical experiences of performers and audience members, but little research has been done on the nature of musical experience itself. The branch of philosophy known as phenomenology explores just that topic: it tries to understand what it means to say that a person “has” an experience, and provides new ideas about the relationship between experience and other philosophical concepts. As Canada Research Chair in Ethnomusicology, Dr. Harris Berger is drawing ground-breaking connections between ethnomusicology and phenomenology. His research is shedding new light on the nature of musical experience and using information from field studies to discover new ideas about the nature of music, the aesthetics of performance, and the political meaning of culture. Berger and his research team are giving music scholars new tools for studying people and music, clarifying basic concepts in arts research, and opening the door to more effective studies of the political and cultural influences of music.

Scientists now know that the enhanced or abnormal pain sensations that typify chronic pain can arise from the misprocessing of touch in the pain processing pathways that run from the spinal cord to the brain. Currently, the most effective treatments for pain, such as opioids like OxyContin and Vicodin, simply numb the pain but don’t treat the underlying physiological mechanisms causing it. Research into how memories are stored, recalled, and changed in the brain has proven useful to the work of Robert Bonin, Canada Research Chair in Sensory Plasticity and Reconsolidation. Memory reconsolidation is triggered by the recall and reactivation of a memory, which temporarily destabilizes and makes it easy to change. The memory later stabilizes and goes back into storage. Preventing the restoring process disrupts the memory, providing a window of opportunity to diminish or even erase it. Injury or very painful sensations can create a memory of the pain in the spinal cord that has much in common with memories in the brain. Bonin has shown that reconsolidation in the spinal cord can be used to treat and even reverse hyperalgesia, an abnormally heightened sensitivity to pain, by reactivating the spinal pain pathways and changing their pain memory. This work is continuing using a variety of approaches such as behavioural, electrophysiological and optogenetic approaches to explore how changes in pain processing pathways of the spinal cord are modified by ongoing sensory activity, and identify factors and corresponding therapeutic targets to end or counter the development of chronic pain.

Those conditions are usually thanks to an overgrowth of algae, which in turn is caused by an over-abundance of nutrients—specifically nitrogen. Humans have been rapidly increasing the amount of nitrogen in the environment by producing fertilizers that will help grow food to support the ever-growing global population. Most of this nitrogen ends up in our oceans. While nitrogen is important for all life, it can be harmful in high doses, causing excessive growth of algae and other microscopic organisms, like bacteria. These microbes breathe all the oxygen out of the water, causing fish and larger organisms to suffocate and die. They also lead to the unsightly, foul-smelling green slick of algae that humans find so off-putting. This phenomenon is known as eutrophication. Dr. Carolyn Buchwald, Canada Research Chair in Ocean Chemistry, has been tackling this problem using “pet microbes.” Grown in her lab, these special microbes can use nitrogen instead of oxygen to breathe. When they use the nitrogen, they convert it from a dissolved form in the water back to a gaseous form, removing it from the water and cleaning up the environment in the process. To study how this works, Buchwald and her research team use chemical labels called stable isotopes. They grow the microbes, measure the effect they have on the stable isotope content in nutrients, and use this information to track their growth in the natural environment. Ultimately, Buchwald’s research could point to new ways to remove nitrogen pollution from coastal waters. "

But several aspects of memory are actually preserved with age. The real issue is our ability to stay focused and tune out distractions. Dr. Karen Campbell, Canada Research Chair in Cognitive Neuroscience in Aging, believes this is what we should be aiming to improve. Distracting information can affect our daily functioning in many ways. It throws us off when we drive, slows down our reading, and gets in the way of our ability to remember the things we want to remember. While people of all ages can get distracted, our ability to ignore distracting sights and sounds tends to worsen with age. Campbell is looking at why this happens. She is examining the neural bases of older adults’ increased distractibility and the implications for memory and other cognitive functions. Campbell and her research team use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to scan younger and older adults’ brains while they perform a variety of cognitive tasks. Then they compare brain activity among the two groups to determine how the brain networks critical for controlling attention differ with age. Campbell’s research will not only contribute to our understanding of how age affects the brain and cognition, but may also point the way to new interventions to help us to stay focused as we age. "

It is made up of several interconnected and integrated activities—such as forecasting, production, inventory control, transportation and warehousing—that account for up to 40 per cent of a product’s cost. These activities have traditionally been treated separately, in part due to the lack of tools powerful enough to tackle them simultaneously. Integrating some of these activities is no easy task. It means using tools based on mathematics, optimization, statistics and computer science, among others. It also means applying a global approach that can take advantage of the synergetic effect of looking at the logistics system as a whole. Another challenge is that the objectives of these different activities often conflict. Can you really save money, work faster and protect the environment all at once? Dr. Coelho, Canada Research Chair in Integrated Logistics, aims to create software capable of doing just that.

",Perfecting Employee Personality Tests," Perfecting Employee Personality Tests Ever wonder why someone got the job? Important decisions on who to hire and who to promote are often based on personality tests. But typical tests, created by applied psychologists, have historically adopted a narrow view in measuring personality, which can lead organizations to choose manipulators and egoists over more suitable candidates. As the Canada Research Chair in Integrative Perspectives on Personality, Brian Connelly is investigating better testing methods that avoid these pitfalls and pave the way for making accurate, data-driven predictions about who has the best chance to succeed and fit in. This can save companies millions in retention and hiring costs every year. Fascinated by the question of who is the best judge of personality—oneself or others—Connelly believes observer-based personality ratings are a promising strategy to help weed out bias and fakery, which are vulnerabilities of standard self-assessments. In this method, the standard tests will be aided by ratings from observers who know the individual well, such as coworkers or close acquaintances, to create a more complete and balanced picture of the job seeker or employee. This work, along with a stronger understanding of where traits, reputations, and identities come from and how they relate to important organizational outcomes, will redefine how we think about and use personality information to make career-changing decisions for people in the workplace.

But for Canada’s sexual and gender minority youth (SGMY), communicating with others online about their struggles is often safer than meeting in person. That’s why information and communication technology like smartphones, and social media vehicles like Facebook and Instagram, hold such promise for reaching Canada’s estimated half-million sexual and gender minority youth. Research has shown that SGMY in crisis—who often experience an array of discrimination and stressors at home, at school and in their community—turn to their phones and social media for information and help instead of reaching out to social services in person. This makes technology an important avenue to create and provide new, innovative and widely available interventions to help them cope and thrive. Shelley Craig, Canada Research Chair in Sexual and Gender Minority Youth, is seeking to improve the well-being of this vulnerable population through research, practice and education. For example, her research will digitize and pilot-test smartphone-enabled coping skills training for SGMY.

Common obstacles include a lack of available treatments, particularly in rural settings, concerns over stigma and a desire for self-reliance. An effective new option to promote recovery is to develop and design interventions for problem gamblers, drinkers, smokers and illicit drug users that they can administer on their own. John Cunningham, the Canada Research Chair in Addictions, is a world-leading expert on the development and evaluation of assisted self-change interventions for addictions, including pioneering research on internet interventions for hazardous drinking. He’s conducting several randomized controlled trials in Canada and Australia. These include internet interventions for heavy drinkers, and mailing nicotine patches to smokers to help them quit. His research will also encompass ways to treat addictions in high-risk situations, in vulnerable or hard-to-reach populations, among illicit drug users and in integrating assisted self-change with face-to-face treatment. For example, using gaming and intervention apps, Cunningham will target heavy drinkers with limited literacy to teach safe drinking techniques and encourage them to employ interventions based on their own reporting of situations where they’re in danger of drinking, such as the holiday season. The long-term goal of Cunningham’s research is a better system of care for people with addictions, fully integrated within the larger healthcare system and widely accessible, both in Canada and internationally.

This is especially true since we now know that instances of maltreatment can have a long-lasting impact not only on the children and their families, but on the whole community as well. Studies have shown that young people who have been abused or neglected can experience a host of physical, mental and behavioural challenges, as well as struggle to form bonds with others. They are also likely to abuse alcohol or drugs. Supporting children and families to achieve better outcomes through evidence-informed policy is the foundation for providing effective interventions.

To understand and predict the impact of global change on animal movement and the survival of isolated populations of the same species, for instance, the field of spatial ecology examines everything from the size of the “patch” where animal communities live to the predators that threaten the survival of their prey. Spatial ecology also examines their adaptability to changes in climate, food availability, disease as well as their reproduction rate.

These devastating injuries change people’s lives forever. Because the adult nervous system cannot repair itself, many of these people are left without the ability to walk or perform everyday tasks that most of us take for granted. Dr. Karim Fouad, Canada Research Chair in Spinal Cord Injury, is focused on neuroplasticity mechanisms (the brain and spinal cord’s ability to reorganize itself by creating new neural connections) to develop treatments that help people recover after spinal cord injury. Fouad and his research team promote neuroplasticity by creating conditions that nerve cells naturally encounter during the development of the body—a time when the nervous system is able to grow. These treatments are then combined with rehabilitative training to stabilize and fine-tune newly established connections between the nerve cells. Plasticity-promoting treatments have only limited effects, since they cannot reconnect the brain with the rest of the body once the majority of nerves have been injured. But these treatments do go hand in hand with regeneration-promoting strategies that provide neurons with a bridge to grow through an injury site.

Depending on the type of cancer, treatments that target the cancerous cells can slow the progression of the disease; some treatments are more accurate than others at this. To develop more effective treatments, researchers must be able to identify the therapeutic targets that are unique to the cancerous cells. In other words, they need to know what to aim new drug therapies at. Certain strains of human papillomavirus (HPV) can cause cervical cancer, along with specific types of cancers of the head and neck (45 per cent of oropharyngeal cancers and 22 per cent of cancers of the larynx and inside the mouth). Even though these cancers cannot develop without a viral infection, whether they will develop—and how they may progress—depends on additional genetic alterations. Dr. Amélie Fradet-Turcotte, Canada Research Chair in Molecular Virology and Genomic Instability, is seeking to better understand how viral infections interfere with the processes that protect cells from these types of genetic alterations. Using an approach based in biochemistry and cellular biology, Fradet-Turcotte’s team focuses on the mechanisms that HPV uses to tamper with the cells that normally protect genomic stability. They are also focusing on the consequences of this tampering on cellular resistance to anti-cancer treatments, like chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Besides leading to a better understanding of the role played by HPV in the development of cancer, Fradet-Turcotte’s research could result in new treatments that more precisely target this type of cancer.

In some cases, such as with Alzheimer’s disease, important memories can be lost. In others, persistent memories tied to traumatic events can lead to depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. To develop better treatments for these maladies, it’s critical to understand how memories are organized and stored in the brain and how they can be altered after they are formed—sometimes by disease. Paul Frankland, Canada Research Chair in Memory Research and a global leader in the field, combines behaviour, imaging and molecular approaches to study memory. In particular, his research focuses on how changes in memory organization, from their creation in the hippocampus to their reorganization in the cortex for long-term storage, affects their quality. He and his team are also building on their discovery that new neurons generated in the hippocampus throughout our lifetimes help the brain create new memories and forget older ones. As with artificial systems, there is a trade-off in brain networks between plasticity (which is the ability to incorporate new information) and stability, which ensures that incorporating new information does not degrade information already stored in the network. Frankland will use whole-brain mapping approaches in mice and zebrafish to define memory networks, identify areas of network vulnerability, and use this knowledge to develop strategies to restore memory function. His team will also use genetic interventions and compounds that emerge from pro-neurogenic drug screens conducted at SickKids hospital to manipulate neurogenesis. By weakening memories after they’ve formed, just like in the film: Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, more effective treatments can be developed for addiction and other disorders associated with abnormal memory persistence or rumination.

Despite this, there is no real consensus in society on what the word means. Amin Ghaziani, Canada Research Chair in Sexuality and Urban Studies, is examining how our preoccupations with biology (sexuality that stems from our chromosomes, hormones, and reproductive functions) and individuated privacy (sexuality as a deeply personal matter related to our need for intimacy) have left us ill-equipped to understand the social, cultural, and spatial expressions of human sexuality. Sexuality is not just a phenomenon of nature nor is it just personal—it is also profoundly public. Social institutions like churches, families, the mass media, the military and schools all assign a particular set of cultural meanings to sex. These meanings influence what we do, with whom, and whether we associate any symbolism or significance to those acts and interactions. This is why sex has an orientation; why it is legible in the eyes of the law; why it inspires political struggles for equality and social justice; and why we as a society at once celebrate and regulate it. Sexuality, in other words, is what happens to sex when it comes into contact with culture. Ghaziani’s research will elevate the status of sexuality as a centrepoint for thought, transforming how future generations think about the meanings of human sexuality. "

They have become a monumental and expensive security problem, with malicious software (malware) quickly becoming a weapon of choice for attackers. As Canada Research Chair in Cybersecurity, Dr. Ali A. Ghorbani is responding to these challenges by helping to build intelligence-driven cybersecurity tools and techniques. Ghorbani and his team are exploring how security data analytics affect our understanding of new and emerging cyber threats and people’s behaviour in cyberspace. Among other priorities, they are interested in how these analytics can support the development of an advanced cyber threat intelligence platform to derive, characterize, model and evaluate cyber threats. Identifying potential outsider and insider attackers is an essential step in understanding and stopping any threat. To this end, Ghorbani and his team are focusing on methods for identifying outsider attackers or rogue employees based on evidence. They are investigating stylistic “clues” to characterize and distinguish malware; developing tools to extract these characteristics from malware source code; and coming up with approaches that attribute malware samples to potential authors based on style. Ghorbani’s research also involves developing an intelligence-driven, people-centric cybersecurity solution that depends on big data analytics, user profiling, and internal and external intelligence gathering networks that allow both insiders acting maliciously and real outside threats to be identified proactively. In addition, he is developing an advanced threat protection system that uses big data analytics to produce intelligence and detect the variations of malware that may reside in a network. Ultimately, Ghorbani’s research will help us to be more secure in cyberspace. "

This is, in fact, the main source of the injuries that seniors experience. With Canada’s population aging rapidly, this is an issue of growing concern. When we’re young, our bodies easily recover from a fall. As we age, not only do we fall more frequently, falls can result in long hospital stays, slow or limited mobility recovery and the loss of independent living, which can have a serious impact on our quality of life. There are many reasons why we fall. One main biological risk factor is poor skeletal muscle strength. Lifting weights at the gym is the best way to increase or maintain our strength as we age, however it’s a modest gain. Recent work by Penney Gilbert, Canada Research Chair in Endogenous Repair and an internationally recognized expert in regenerative medicine and mechanobiology, suggests one of the reasons our muscles weaken with age is that our muscle stem cells lose their potency. Using a stem cell-targeted therapeutic approach, she’s working to identify and validate biomolecules that can rejuvenate muscle stem cells inside the body. She will also engineer a new human micro-tissue platform to test and create personalized medicine for skeletal muscles, and uncover novel ways human stem cells are controlled in the body to reveal new therapeutic entry points. This work will contribute to the international reputation of the University of Toronto and Canada as a regenerative medicine leader, while delivering strategies to help Canadians maintain muscle strength through all the stages of their life.

This is a time of identity development and possibility, but also of instability and uncertainty. It’s a period marked at times by risky behaviour like binge drinking, gambling and unsafe sex. It’s also a peak time for the emergence of mental health issues. Compared to past generations, today’s emerging adults are living at home longer, and taking longer to enter the workforce and achieve longer-term stability. These changes are not only impacting their individual growth but are also creating significant economic and labour market shifts. Abby Goldstein, Canada Research Chair in the Psychology of Emerging Adulthood, is studying the psychological factors that influence changes in risk, wellness and well-being over time, and impact healthy transitions into adulthood. In addition, she’s investigating the impact of relationships with parents on these risk and wellness trajectories—identifying strategies to support parents and emerging adults as they navigate this critical stage of life. Because emerging adults are the “tech-savvy generation,” Goldstein is using research methods that are integrated with the technology they use to document their daily lives. Using a mobile app, participants will make reports for 30 days in each year of this four-year study, detailing their mood, risk behaviours, wellness behaviours and interactions with their parents, as well as any major changes in their transition to adulthood. This research will provide essential insight into the lives of Canadian emerging adults. It will identify both general and specific factors that impact their unique trajectories, establish targets for interventions to reduce risk behaviours, and help inform public policy to create novel strategies that will support young people as they navigate this critical time of life.

What if machines could automatically learn useful skills by interacting with data that are already freely available? Dr. Yuhong Guo, Canada Research Chair in Machine Learning, is developing novel machine learning technologies that can reduce dependence on human annotation by using existing alternative data sources. The popularity of digital devices and the globalization of information has caused an explosion in multimedia, multilingual, diverse data that cover all aspects of human activity. The emergence of these varied data resources has created an opportunity to reduce the amount of new human annotation needed to develop successful machine learning systems. Guo and her research team are developing representation learning methods that enable information to be shared automatically between different languages, data sources and modalities. Their approach reduces the need for human annotation in diverse applications, such as document categorization, sentiment analysis, structured text analysis, object recognition in images and videos, and health and medical data analysis. In addition to achieving significant cost reductions, Guo's research is also broadening the applicability of automated data analysis to domains where human expertise is scarce. Ultimately, Guo’s research will broaden the applicability of machine learning methods to address the intelligent data analysis needs of corporations, organizations and governments. "

And while there’s no escaping air pollution in the city, some areas are better than others. Capturing these variations in air quality using environmental sensors, and sharing them in real-time on GPS-enabled smartphones means individuals may soon have more control over their exposure to traffic-related air pollution. Marianne Hatzopoulou, Canada Research Chair in Transportation and Air Quality, is the first person in Canada to create an integrated transportation/air pollution/population exposure tool to help cyclists and pedestrians avoid smoggy routes in Montreal and Toronto. Now, she’s expanding her work and the areas it covers by collecting air pollution data from pedestrians and cyclists wearing special sensors and GPS units as they move around a city. This data will then automatically be transmitted to their smartphone via Bluetooth and transferred to a central server at the University of Toronto, where air pollution levels are spatially interpolated to generate a time-varying map. This real-time air quality map will be available to the public as a smartphone app to see how the information affects their travel route decisions to avoid high-pollution areas. It will also be used to study the influence of traffic congestion, queuing, and aggressive driving on air pollution. This five-year research project will enable Hatzopoulou to evaluate the potential of mobile apps to change behaviour.

It is one of the most fundamental, yet vital, aspects of human movement. Yet all too often, people leave work at the end of the day feeling tired and suffering from aches or pains. This not only influences their performance at work, but their quality of life at home. Although the human hand and forearm have unimaginable complexity, the basic activities of daily living, like reaching for a cup of coffee, come naturally to most people. But even simple movements require the brain to initiate a complex series of coordinated events. Unfortunately, such a complex system lends itself to complex problems. Work-related pain and injury to the upper extremities, such as carpal tunnel syndrome and repetitive strain injury, are a common cause of sick leave and disability among working adults. As Canada Research Chair in Neuromuscular Mechanics and Ergonomics, Dr. Michael Holmes is trying to understand why some people develop workplace injuries while others who perform the same work do not. Holmes and his research team are investigating how the brain determines muscle recruitment and control strategies, as well as how these influence the risk of injury. By performing workplace simulations, they hope to better understand how pain and injury interact with neural and mechanical output.

Usually, these age-related diseases are studied independently, but Dr. Basil Hubbard, Canada Research Chair in Molecular Therapeutics, is taking a different approach. By studying changes in biological molecules related to age, Hubbard aims to target the common hallmarks underlying all of these diseases. This approach could lead to the development of new drugs to treat multiple age-related diseases at the same time. Proteins are functional biomolecules that carry out various important activities in human cells. Small chemical modifications such as acetyl can be added or removed from proteins to tune their function when necessary. But as cells age, this process often becomes less regulated. Hubbard and his research team are investigating how and why this occurs to better understand how abnormal protein modification contributes to disease. For example, the accumulation of acetyl has been linked to diseases like breast cancer, heart disease and age-related hearing loss. Using molecular biology and biochemistry, Hubbard’s team is identifying the regulators that deposit and remove these modifications—and looking for ways to control them. By understanding how to regulate protein modifications, Hubbard hopes to produce new drugs and diagnostics for age-related diseases. His findings could also help reduce the cost of developing these drugs by identifying single compounds that can help prevent and treat multiple diseases at once. "

This blue revolution has been so successful that most of the salmon that people eat are now raised in open sea pens that dot the coastal seas of countries such as Canada, Norway and Chile. But, intensive aquaculture production hasn’t been without its risks.

In applied mathematics, traditional studies of diffusion have used the calculus notions of differentiation and integration. A consequence of depending on this classic understanding of diffusion is that the mean square radius of dispersion evolves linearly with time. But in reality, the evolution of diffusive processes is often non-linear (anomalous). Modelling anomalous diffusion requires fractional derivatives and integrals. But these fractional operators are much less known, and cannot be analyzed using traditional mathematical tools. As Canada Research Chair in Applied Mathematics and Optimization, Dr. Yana Nec is trying to shed light on these fractional operators and improve our understanding of systems with diffusion anomalies. Nec and her research team are developing the theoretical background needed to study differential equations and dynamical systems with such operators. They are also devising custom numerical schemes to support asymptotic predictions (a method of describing limiting behavior), and are applying this knowledge to diffusive processes with anomalies, such as signaling in immune systems. This area of research is multi-disciplinary and opens avenues to unique collaborations between academia and industry. For example, Nec combines her expertise in applied mathematics with principles of fluid dynamics to solve practical problems in industry, such as the best strategies for dam controls to minimize harm to rivers. Ultimately, Nec hopes that by developing realistic models, her research will improve engineering practices as well as enhance the expertise of industrial personnel and increase their environmental awareness.

Dr. Serge Rivest, Canada Research Chair in Neuroimmunology, is seeking to develop an immunotherapy that would stimulate the immune system, allowing it to eliminate this toxic protein without causing excessive inflammation. Rivest and his research team are evaluating various new synthetic adjuvants that may improve the effectiveness of existing medicines. Thanks to revolutionary medical imaging techniques that let us see what is happening in the brains of mice with Alzheimer’s, Rivest and his team are studying a category of white blood cells (called surveillance monocytes) that selectively attack the amyloid proteins that attach to the walls of the brain’s blood vessels. These protein aggregates in block the brain’s oxygenation, leading to cognitive decline. The impressive images obtained by Rivest and his team show that these surveillance monocytes are attracted to the amyloid in the veins of the brain. They attach themselves near the aggregates and progressively eliminate them. But as the disease progresses, this defence mechanism becomes less effective—so it becomes necessary to stimulate it. Ultimately, Rivest’s research will help develop a safe, effective immunotherapy that will allow us to slow the development of the disease and help prevent the accumulation of beta-amyloid protein in patients who are most at risk of developing Alzheimer’s.

Using agricultural waste (or ""weeds"") to develop sustainable and effective materials is Dr. Mathieu Robert’s challenge. Canada is one of the world’s biggest agricultural producers. But every year, we also generate huge amounts of waste—such as straw, waste vegetables and peelings—that have overlooked economic potential. For instance, flax seed, of which Canada is the world's largest producer, generates 1.2 million tons of straw annually, most of which is not put to use. Our food industry also produces waste that contains high levels of starch fibres and nanocrystals, which can be used in food packaging, automotive applications, clothing or construction. As Canada Research Chair in Polymer Eco-Composites, Robert and his research team are processing these wastes to see if they can extract products that can be modified for use in polymers. The idea is that improving some of their properties or preventing their degradation could make them compatible for alternative uses. Robert's research could have many practical benefits. For example, milkweed (used to produce silk in America) could be grown in soil considered unfit for other farming, or in contaminated soil. Their work could also reduce the environmental impact of producing and eliminating traditional composites. Ultimately, Robert and his team are helping build tomorrow's clean industry, and putting Canada on the path to high-performance ecological materials. "

In fact, our prehistoric eras are named after the materials that defined them, such as the Stone Age, the Bronze Age and the Iron Age. Our present age could very well be called the Advanced Materials or Nanomaterials Age. This is because there has been explosive growth in materials research, especially in nanoscience, which studies the properties of materials at the nano scale. This growth is making the most of new instruments for synthesizing and characterizing materials. Scanning probe microscopy techniques are a good example: they allow us to visualize and modify surfaces at the atomic scale. New nanostructured materials are expected to provide society with radically new technologies in the years to come. As innovation in materials science and engineering relies more and more on our ability to understand and control what materials can do, “materials by design” are becoming a reality. Dr. Federico Rosei, Canada Research Chair in Nanostructured Materials, is working on understanding the synthesis, processing and characterization of nanomaterials—work that could support the development of systems with tailor-made properties. To do this, Rosei and his research team are correlating structure (morphology and composition) with properties in different classes of multifunctional materials and investigating dynamic properties. Ultimately, their work could lead to new insights that support technological breakthroughs in energy, electronics and health, consolidating Canada’s leadership in advanced materials. "

Although access to secure housing and adequate, quality food are related, they are often studied as separate domains. Dr. Marit Rosol, Canada Research Chair in Global Urban Studies, wants to bring them into the same discussion. Rosol and her team will explore questions like: What causes food and/or housing insecurity? What are the locally specific factors and the more general, even global, trends? What does it mean for urban residents in their daily lives? Who is working to overcome these problems, how, and with what results? What are the most pressing problems facing our current food systems—and what changes would activists, NGOs or local governments like to see happen in and beyond their cities? To find answers, Rosol’s research program will explore several related issues in urban areas of North America and Europe: the socio-political context, relevance and political actions of alternative food and food justice movements; social, economic and physical aspects of access to housing and food; the influence of politics on housing policies; and the consequences of urban austerity policies on access to both affordable housing and food. As a geographer, Rosol is particularly interested in the uneven manifestations and consequences of food (in)justice and (un)affordable housing in different places. By analyzing Canadian examples and providing insights from other cities and countries, Rosol hopes to inform food and housing policy discussions nationally and internationally. "

Hepatitis C is a chronic disease that affects more than 170 million people globally, including 268,000 Canadians. Meanwhile, dengue and Zika represent an even larger problem, with 2.5 billion people at risk worldwide. While the dengue and Zika viruses typically lead to mild flu-like illnesses, they have been increasingly associated with more severe neurological illnesses. Dr. Selena Sagan, Canada Research Chair in RNA Biology and Viral Infections, is working toward understanding the interactions between ribonucleic acid (RNA) viruses and their hosts, in particular those interactions that influence how viruses replicate and diseases develop. RNA viruses—viruses whose genomes are comprised of ribonucleic acid—rely on their genomes as a blueprint for infection. The viral genome must encode all the information needed to make viral proteins, copy the genome and reproduce. To do this, the genome itself must be a dynamic structure that can unwind, elongate and expose regions of the viral RNA to both host and viral proteins that facilitate infection. However, how viruses regulate and coordinate these activities with just a single piece of RNA remains a mystery. Sagan and her research team are dissecting the mechanisms by which RNA viruses regulate these events to cause disease. Their research will further our understanding of RNA virus replication and may lead to new treatments for these diseases. "

This delay can result in substandard care for patients and a great deal of waste when it comes to research. Canada needs a better way to move research “from the bench to the bedside”—that is, a more efficient transfer of knowledge between researchers, clinicians and policy-makers. As a specialized area of health care, the goal of rehabilitation is to optimize physical function and quality of life. But continuing gaps between research and practice are leading to poorer patient outcomes. As Canada Research Chair in Integrated Knowledge Translation in Rehabilitation Science, Dr. Kathryn Sibley is looking at how to move research into action in rehabilitation sciences. Sibley and her research team are using an integrated approach, where the end-users of rehabilitation research— patients, clinicians, and decision makers—are involved in the research process from start to finish. They are identifying critical research-to-practice gaps and testing methods to close them. They are also promoting more consistent research practices to ensure rehabilitation treatments can be accurately compared across studies, and developing better ways to share new research. By increasing the application and use of rehabilitation strategies that are backed by research evidence, Sibley’s work will help improve Canadians’ health, function and quality of life. What’s more, her methods will transform rehabilitation science by integrating knowledge translation throughout the research and innovation pipeline. "

They also represent an enormous economic burden, as they can result in severe permanent impairments that cost the health care system billions of dollars. Despite clinical advances, we still face important knowledge gaps when it comes to managing the care of survivors. As Canada Research Chair in Critical Care Neurology and Trauma, Dr. Alexis Turgeon is looking to fill these gaps. The goal of his research is to improve bedside practices and outcomes in critically ill patients with traumatic brain injury by using evidence-based, patient-centred decision-making.

But these opportunities also carry the risk of chemical contamination of the Arctic’s vulnerable ecosystems. When glaciers and sea ice melt, they can release “legacy” contaminants that have been stored for a long time. Resource development and shipping can also introduce new contaminants. As Canada Research Chair in Arctic Environmental Chemistry, Dr. Feiyue Wang is working on understanding the release and effects of contaminants in the Arctic under a changing climate. Wang’s research has shown that Arctic contamination is driven not only by the quantity of contaminants entering the system, but increasingly by climate-induced changes within Arctic ecosystems. For example, a rapidly changing sea ice environment alters how contaminants are transported between the air and the ocean. It also affects how contaminants get into marine organisms—throughout the food chain, all the way up to beluga whales and polar bears. Building upon his pioneering research on mercury in sea ice, Wang and his research team are studying oil and other emerging contaminants associated with Arctic development. Wang’s studies have shown that even when contaminant emissions in Arctic ecosystems are brought under control, it can take a long time before the situation improves. Wang’s research on the interplay between chemical contamination and climate change will provide critical knowledge and tools to improve policies and practices. Ultimately, this work will lead to sustainable development in the Arctic in the context of a changing climate. "

Many studies have been done in macaque monkeys, rats and mice to examine the dynamics of their nervous systems in motor learning and execution. Yet our understanding of the molecular events that underlie these dynamics is still poor, especially with regards to rapid changes in gene expression. Improving this understanding is essential for developing new therapies for stroke rehabilitation. As Canada Research Chair in Neural Circuits and Behavior, Dr. Simon Chen aims to bridge the gap between cellular and molecular signalling and the plasticity of the neural circuits involved in motor learning and execution. He plans to uncover the inter-relationships between the molecular, structural and functional dynamics of the neural networks that evolve while mice are learning and carrying out motor movements. Chen and his research team will use a number of cutting-edge techniques to explore these questions, such as two-photon imaging, a technique that allows imaging of living tissue up to about a millimetre in depth. They will also use genetic approaches that can target and isolate ribonucleic acid (RNA) from different populations of neurons in the motor cortex. Chen aims to advance our understanding of brain plasticity associated with learning, and apply the same methodologies to understand circuit dysfunctions and disturbances in diseased brains.

Treatment currently consists of surgery followed by a combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Although aggressive, this approach increases the average patient’s survival rate to just over a year. The failure to date to find a better treatment is in part caused by the extreme variability of these cancer cells. Some of these cells hijack normal stem cell self-renewal programs and contribute to tumor growth. In glioblastoma, these cells (called cancer stem cells) are resistant to current treatments, so targeting them is virtually impossible.

On top of the personal suffering this causes, it costs Canada $50 billion a year. But treating chronic pain is a challenge for doctors because, in most cases, complaints of persistent pain are not directly related to tissue symptoms. Instead, it is believed that chronic pain is associated with changes in the brain and influenced by psychosocial factors. Our lack of understanding of the factors behind chronic pain is a major reason for the high rate of treatment failure: about half of patients don’t report significant pain relief with treatment. Chronic pain mismanagement can also lead to drug abuse, tolerance, addiction and overdose-related deaths. Dr. Javeria Hashmi, Canada Research Chair in Pain, believes this situation can be improved by personalising pain treatments to fit the specific needs of each patient. Hashmi is studying the cognitive mechanisms, brain properties, medical histories and psychosocial makeup of people with chronic pain to develop better diagnostic tools. Using principles of computational neuroscience, machine learning and network analysis, Hashmi and her research team aim to examine the unique therapeutic needs of each chronic pain patient. The biomarkers (measures used to perform clinical assessments) that emerge from this research will determine the treatments that are most likely to benefit a given patient. Ultimately, Hashmi’s work will improve and streamline the treatment process for chronic pain, and reduce healthcare costs by replacing the “one size fits all” approach with strategies tailored to fit the unique needs of each patient.

The need to provide such evidence can have significant effects on community-level organization, grassroots social movements, forms of resistance and political dissent. Dr. Robert Lorway, Canada Research Chair in Global Intervention Politics and Social Transformation, is exploring these effects. To guide his research, Lorway is employing a concept he calls “evidentiary sovereignty,” by which he means the power to determine what knowledge is admissible in global decision-making arenas. Through this lens, Lorway and his research team are examining how diverse members of society (such as community activists, practitioners, government officials and scientists) figure out what counts as “acceptable knowledge” in planning, implementing, and monitoring and evaluating program practices. Their research is revealing the profound impact on communities’ social and political realities when funders insist on evidence. For example, Lorway’s research examines what happens when disenfranchised communities in Asia and Africa become more and more entangled in the evidence-production procedures imposed by global funders. Using global health contexts as a case study, he is analyzing the unexpected social transformations that take place when communities reassemble expert knowledge to establish political networks that span multiple nations, challenge scientific authority and affect access to resources. Ultimately, this research will help global policymakers, scientific experts and practitioners develop more democratic ways of designing, executing and monitoring global interventions. Lorway’s research is also changing how we see parallel social and political processes taking place in Canada. "
Debbie Martin,Martin,Debbie,Canada Research Chair in Indigenous Peoples’ Health and Well-Being,Tier 2,Health,Dalhousie University,902-494-7717,dhmartin@dal.ca,,Investigating the impact of Indigenous perspectives in preventing chronic disease in Indigenous communities.,This research will identify strategies for improved chronic disease outcomes for Indigenous peoples.,Looking to Indigenous Ways of Knowing to Improve Indigenous Peoples’ Health," Looking to Indigenous Ways of Knowing to Improve Indigenous Peoples’ Health Human health and well-being are deeply entwined with the Earth’s health and wellbeing. In this sense, the way we treat the lands and waters around us is often a reflection of our own health. Canada’s Indigenous peoples are “of this place”—meaning they emerged from its lands and waters. But their relationship with the Earth was significantly interrupted by European settlement, and colonization continues to have a profound impact on their present-day health and social conditions and communities. Indigenous peoples within Canada fare more poorly than their non-Indigenous counterparts on virtually every measure of health and social well-being. By recognizing the intricate inter-relationship between the health of people and that of the natural world, Dr. Debbie Martin, Canada Research Chair in Indigenous Peoples’ Health and Well-Being, aims to generate effective chronic disease prevention strategies in Indigenous communities. She and her research team are working with communities to bring the long-standing wisdom of Indigenous perspectives on health and well-being into the complex sphere of chronic disease prevention research. For example, Martin and her team will explore the applicability of “two-eyed seeing” as a way to improve the health of Indigenous peoples. Two-eyed seeing suggests that the most complex problems facing our world today require the benefit of diverse perspectives, hence the pressing need for Indigenous voices and knowledge to be valued alongside western scientific perspectives. Ultimately, the goal of Martin’s research is to develop strategies for improving chronic disease outcomes in Indigenous communities using approaches that both respect and value diverse ways of knowing.

As Canada Research Chair in Primate Genomics and Dietary Ecology, Dr. Amanda Melin is studying the genes and behaviours of primates, including humans, to better understand how their senses guide their food choices. She is also trying to determine how variations in the environment—from the seasons to climate change—affect primates’ foraging behaviour and health outcomes. To better understand and their habitats, Melin and her research team are integrating evolutionary genomics (or molecular evolution) with behavioural and ecological data collected in the field. By analyzing the genes underlying the senses, and measuring food properties in tropical environments (such as Costa Rica), Melin and her team hope to reveal the essential roles played by colour vision, smell, taste and touch in the ecology of our species and our primate relatives, such as capuchin and howler monkeys. In addition, Melin and her team are conducting yearly surveys of the gut microbiome of wild primates, such as capuchin, to better understand how changing climates are affecting their diets and health. By studying the impact of environmental variation and food abundance in a natural system, she hopes to better understand and identify healthy gut microbes and their functional roles, ultimately shedding light on human health.

It is already creating a digital revolution where interconnected consumer devices and sensors are enabling increased process and workflow automation as well as new services. But our current electronics infrastructure cannot support this massive network’s energy demands. Above all, our current approaches cannot efficiently satisfy its growing request for information processing and data transfer. Dr. Roberto Morandotti, Canada Research Chair in Smart Photonics, is using optics and photonics—with an emphasis on quantum phenomena—to find new ways to support the development of a faster and more power-efficient IoT network (through things such as high-bandwidth and low-energy fibre telecommunications). Morandotti and his research team are looking to on-chip (integrated) photonics as an ideal platform for next-generation “smart” devices and other practical implementations, since it is intrinsically power-efficient and scalable, with high-bandwidth. More importantly, photonics has the potential to solve problem-specific computations faster than electronics. In particular, by making use of classical and quantum optical properties—such as interference and entanglement—optical (quantum) processing can achieve unprecedented parallelism and information processing speed. These properties may offer solutions to today's challenges in manipulating big data. Ultimately, Morandotti’s research will have applications in a wide range of fields related to telecommunications, computer technologies and sensing, and will help to put both Canada and Quebec on the map when it comes to research in this area.

Understanding what drives its spread is crucial if we are to develop more effective prevention and control programs. Mathematical modelling—the use of computer-based simulations of how a disease spreads through a population—offers a virtual “laboratory” to help us understand what factors influence how a disease is spread and to examine various “what if” scenarios. Modelling is a particularly powerful tool for designing and evaluating HIV prevention programmes because it can provide long-term projections of their impact and cost-effectiveness. Dr. Mike Pickles, Canada Research Chair in Mathematical Modelling and Global Public Health, aims to develop innovative mathematical models that describe the challenges of treating and preventing HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). These data-driven models will draw on knowledge from epidemiology and health sciences to help understand the complex interactions between social, individual and biological factors and how these interactions influence the HIV epidemic, both in Canada and globally. With a better quantitative understanding of these factors, it may be possible to design better prevention programs to address them. The work done by Pickles and his research team will have a significant impact on global public health by enabling policy-makers to tailor HIV/STI prevention programs to ensure they maximize health benefits and are as cost-effective possible.

With the rise of powerful computers, simulation (producing a model of something in order to study it) has become a third pillar of the foundation of science. Interactions between atoms and molecules are behind every physical, chemical and biological process. Molecular simulation—now used in fields like physics, chemistry, material science, biotechnology, drug design and neuroscience—uses super computers and sophisticated models to understand these interactions. Dr. Peter Tieleman, Canada Research Chair in Molecular Simulation, aims to develop models and algorithms that will broaden the scope of molecular simulation. He also wants to use these models to help solve a range of biological problems, from the mechanisms of cell function to drug-delivery technologies. In biochemistry, molecular simulation typically relies on detailed models of the key players in cells—lipids, proteins, nucleic acids, carbohydrates—and a cast of smaller players. These models can include millions of individual atoms, and can span time scales from femtoseconds to milliseconds as well as length scales from the size of a water molecule to fragments of cells. They provide a level of detail that goes well beyond any experiment, and offer a unique window on the world of atoms and molecules. One day, simulations will help solve some of the most pressing biomedical challenges of our time—from overcoming antibiotic resistance to realizing personalized medicine.

Meanwhile, existing cholesterol-lowering drugs are only partially effective at reducing the risk of heart attacks and strokes. New therapies are urgently needed to combat this deadly disease. Dr. Mireille Ouimet, Canada Research Chair in Cardiovascular Metabolism and Cell Biology, is looking for new ways to improve the removal of cholesterol from atherosclerotic plaques, stop the plaques from growing bigger, and possibly even reduce their size. Ouimet and her research team are testing whether increasing a process in cells called “autophagy”—which breaks down lipids and exports them—could achieve this. Autophagy plays a key role in recycling toxic elements from cells and promotes cell survival during periods of cell stress. Through autophagy, cellular components are delivered to organelles called lysosomes (the waste disposal system of the cell), which digest unwanted materials. Ouimet’s research has already shown that autophagy can also engulf and digest cholesterol that has accumulated in the artery wall. This process helps remove cholesterol, providing an entirely new therapeutic target to reverse atherosclerosis. By shedding light on the fundamental mechanisms of lipid autophagy, Ouimet and her research team hope to identify pathway components that can be targeted and manipulated to treat heart disease. They are also looking for new targets for developing drugs that can increase cholesterol breakdown and export by cells in the artery wall. "

As a result, many populations of Canada’s iconic wildlife—caribou, elk, deer, wolves, bears—are declining. Much of this is because people have disrupted the types of interactions that occur between species. What’s more, the links in the food chain are broken. To counter these impacts, restoration ecology has emerged as one of the most important disciplines in the life sciences. Restoration also forms the backbone of environmental legislation in Canada. However, if restoration is to succeed, scientists must develop and translate new knowledge about how people affect species interactions. Adam T. Ford, Canada Research Chair in Restoration Ecology, is examining the impact of human activity on the interactions among large predators (wolves, bears, cougars), their prey (deer, elk) and plants in human-modified landscapes. Ford’s research will use a combination of field experiments, GPS tracking, computer models and satellite images to bring together the ecology of individuals, populations and communities. Specifically, Ford is investigating how forestry practices, urban growth and the existence of highways not only change species abundance, but also the manner in which these species move through the landscape and interact with one another. Ford’s work will also test the success of new management techniques aimed at stabilizing wildlife populations. The goal is to ensure the recovery of wildlife populations, and to inform management strategies and policy that is focused on protecting and restoring Canada’s landscapes. "
