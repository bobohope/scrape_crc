Developments in the last twenty years have clearly demonstrated that secondary metabolites fulfill many key biological roles in plants, and some studies have suggested that some secondary metabolites such as flavonoids (a group of aromatic compounds that includes many common pigments) may have important disease fighting properties.The Canada Research Chair in Plant Biochemistry and Biotechnology, Dr. Vincenzo De Luca, has focused his research on explaining natural product biosynthesis in plants. He will continue to study how plants generate cell-specific biochemical factories for natural product biosynthesis. The outcome of this research will be to produce detailed information about the balance of genes that are responsible for creating particular cell factories, and to create new pathways. The novel chemistries generated may be used to: defend plants against different plant pathogens; produce valuable medicines; produce new functional foods; and produce valuable new aromas, flavours and colorants.As an example of the research application in industry, simple field-based global metabolic measurements could be used to define the most appropriate time to harvest grapes for making wine. Such technology may also be applicable to a number of other crops. The value of this technology can be tested at Brock University's Cool Climate and Oenology Viticulture Institute (CCOVI), where there are excellent facilities for making wine under highly defined experimental conditions.Dr. De Luca's innovative, interdisciplinary program will involve the collaborative efforts of molecular biologists, plant physiologists, pathologists and analytical chemists. His research will attract students and researchers from Canada and abroad, since implementation will require training in the skilled use of novel tools for genomics, proteomics, metabolic flux analysis and metabolic profiling, highly useful skills in academic and industrial laboratories.

Stress has been conclusively linked to a host of mental and physical conditions. Depressive illness alone affects one in ten Canadians. Furthermore, depressed patients access health care services an average of six times more often for physical maladies both real and imagined. As cost for the treatment of depression and anxiety continues to soar along with the steady increase in new patients, researchers are redoubling their efforts to provide new relief.Dr. Hymie Anisman is a world-renowned neuroscientist and leading researcher on the causes of stress-induced illness. His exploration of the pharmacological and neurochemical basis for depression and anxiety has received numerous international citations. He and his team are now engaged in extending that research beyond looking for causes to looking for ways to counteract the changes brought on by stress.Dr. Anisman's research examines the effect that stress has on chemical and hormonal activity in the brain. These neurochemical alterations are the same as those associated with chronic depression. There is also evidence to suggest persons who might be genetically predisposed to depression (by family history) are made more susceptible to developing severe symptoms from stress.Stress-induced physical changes are also under study. It is thought that acute stressful events lead to alterations of immune system activity, making a person vulnerable to viral and bacterial infections which their bodies might otherwise resist with ease.Since bi-directional communication occurs between the brain and the immune system, the researchers are also attempting to determine what signaling molecules might be involved in this interaction, and how these come to influence anxiety and depression. As the central research continues, the researchers are evaluating various compounds that might reduce anxiety. These involve new pharmacological treatments, including natural herb compounds that have fewer side effects than current medications. "

Each species has its own unique way of dealing with stresses and lifestyle demands. For organisms in cold and northern regions, survival is dependent upon adapting to extremes of temperature, oxygen deprivation and water restriction. For some species, cells and organs thrive under such conditions.The exploration of cell adaptation begins with gene expression. What mitochondrial genes enable certain mammals to reduce their metabolic rate by 95 percent and core body temperature to near 0° C during hibernation? How can some species' organs sustain freezing and thawing without becoming damaged? How can animals survive for weeks at a time without oxygen? Delving into the genetic basis for such behaviour will ultimately allow us to apply what is learned to human cells.Carleton University's Strategic Research Plan in the Life Sciences takes a broad based approach to the study of organisms in their environment, with a special focus on northern and cold regions and encouragement for collaborations with outside institutions and organizations. The Biology, Chemistry and Biochemistry departments at Carleton University will presently be undergoing dramatic changes, renovations and upgrades in the interest of fostering research. At the centre of these faculties' work is that of Dr. Kenneth B. Storey.Dr. Storey has been part of Carleton University's Institute of Biochemistry since 1979. In keeping with the university's support for collaborative efforts, Dr. Storey has - while maintaining a multi-disciplinary career within the university, involving himself in the Departments of Biology and Chemistry - developed close ties with physiologists in the Department of Biology at the University of Ottawa.

With threats like malicious software and individuals exploiting Internet users for personal gain, it is critical that we find ways to mitigate threats. As Canada Research Chair in Authentication and Computer Security, Dr. Paul Van Oorschot is looking to create new defensive software technologies that will do this. He and his research team are focusing on user and device authentication. By better understanding the vulnerabilities in existing authentication technologies, they hope to reinforce existing methods and design new, more secure and easier-to-use techniques. Van Oorschot and his team are looking to strengthen security infrastructure for web server authentication by improving or replacing the certificate framework and protocols underlying the TLS/SSL architecture (the cryptographic protocols that provide communications security over computer networks.) In addition, they are performing concrete analysis and systematic study of realistic threats to current systems, many of which still rely on passwords for primary authentication. By helping us better understand software vulnerabilities, especially with respect to authentication, Van Oorschot’s research will improve the security of computer systems around the world. It will also lead to the design of mechanisms and architectures that are better able to resist practical threats, ultimately making the Internet safer for conveying and controlling valuable digital content.

Dealing with economic and political issues separately may work well for traditional economic analysis of how to achieve a particular social objective, or for narrow political examination of electoral contests, but not when a full understanding of the forces that shape our fiscal system is needed. A more complete analysis of the level and structure of public spending and taxing requires research that integrates public economics with the study of voting behavior, political competition, and electoral institutions, to create conceptual models of what governments actually do and why. Although research over the last few decades has advanced our understanding of the political economy of fiscal and other public policies, the gap between the fiscal facts familiar to most citizens and the structures found in most existing models remains too wide. Carleton University Professor Stanley L. Winer, a leading scholar in the study of public finance and democratic decision making, is working to bridge that gap. He is co-author of ""Democratic Choice and Taxation,"" one of the most influential publications on the political economy of taxation in recent years. His pioneering research is highly valued worldwide by his peers, public-finance economists and practitioners, and by scholars from several disciplines. As Chair of Public Policy, Professor Winer is working to expand his innovative, interdisciplinary work. His research is now focused on the identification and analysis of the permanent (or longer run) and cyclical components of complete fiscal systems, over long periods and across countries with different electoral regimes. He is also investigating the interdependence of fiscal and other policy instruments such as regulation. The general objective is a deeper understanding of the economic and political forces that underlie the evolution of our public sector. "

Dealing with pain in children is much more complex than in adult patients, since children often lack coping mechanisms and the ability to communicate the type and degree of pain they experience.Dr. Patrick McGrath has built an international reputation for his groundbreaking work in the field of pain in young patients. He has developed behavioural pain measures for short sharp pain, for postoperative pain and for pain in children with severe cognitive impairment. His work on the treatment of migraine in adolescents is widely recognized. As Canada Research Chair in Pediatric Pain at Dalhousie University and the IWK Health Centre, Dr. McGrath will expand the work of the university's Pediatric Pain Research Lab in areas including: delivery of care by distance treatment; the use of brain waves for pain measurement, and the measurement and control of pain in cognitively impaired children and infants. The work will come under the umbrella of two main research themes: the efficient and effective delivery of services to treat pain and other problems; and the development of better measures of pain.Outreach is a major thrust of the Pediatric Pain Research Lab, with ongoing projects that include the Pediatric Pain Sourcebook, a Web-based resource on pain protocols, policies and pamphlets, the Pediatric Pain Letter, a quarterly newsletter for professionals, the Pediatric Pain Listserv that has over seven-hundred participants in forty-five countries and a biennial international conference, the International Forum on Pediatric Pain that leads to the production of a book.

An urgent need exists for more effective models of marine environments as well as novel methods for analyzing the accelerating flow of data from various observing platforms including satellites and autonomous floats carried around by ocean currents. Dr. Keith R. Thompson is renowned for leading edge research in oceanography, and is a leader in the development of computationally-efficient and effective techniques of assimilating data. His extensive collaborations with regional government agencies, and key national and international partners will serve him well as Canada Research Chair in Marine Prediction and Environmental Statistics.Along with his team, Dr. Thompson seeks to improve the predictive capabilities of physically- and statistically-based models of marine environments, and to assess the impact of environmental change. His research involves four key projects focused on combining advanced statistical methodologies with time-dependent dynamical models.In one project, the team will take part in the Global Ocean Data Assimilation Experiment (GODAE), an international program seeking to demonstrate the feasibility of conducting routine ocean forecasts on a global scale. Dr. Thompson's team will focus specifically on the North Atlantic, combining ocean models currently in use at Dalhousie with new data streams drawn from GODAE.

Energy consumption has been increasing steadily due to industrial requirements and an increase in living standards. Contemporary life depends more and more on the consumption of electrical energy, for both work and leisure. Available energy resources with low-adverse environmental impact are growing scarcer. The addition of new electric plant and transmission lines is becoming more difficult because of economic and environmental considerations. These constraints, together with the increasing demand, mean that new solutions must be found to improve the efficiency of the equipment connected to the power grid, particularly the power electronic converters now widely used as interfaces between the grid and most industrial equipment. Energy pollution and interference created by the extensive use of these power electronic converters could create obstacles to further development in the future. Dr. Kamal Al-Haddad has gained extensive experience in designing and developing advanced energy conversion systems, including high efficiency, soft switching converters and high frequency power supplies for telecommunications, induction heating for manufacturing facilities, and other various industrial applications. As Canada Research Chair in Electric Energy Conversion - Power Electronics, Dr. Al-Haddad will focus on three key sectors: energy efficiency and electric power quality in electrical distribution networks; power supply sources for telecommunications systems; and electric traction systems for passenger transport.In addition to conducting fundamental and applied research to develop new technologies, Dr. Al-Haddad will train personnel with the aim of transferring them and the technology to industry. Dr. Al-Haddad and his Group on Power Electronics and Industrial Control have worked closely with industry in the past.

So convincing was the power of antibiotics that, in 1969, US Surgeon-General William Stewart declared that society could ""close the book on infectious disease."" But, in the years since then, his optimism has been replaced by a deep concern regarding the rise of drug-resistant microbes. Increasingly, bacterial and fungal infections have become harder to treat with currently available antimicrobial agents.As Canada Research Chair in Structural Biology, Dr. Albert Berghuis will aim to develop new therapeutics for combatting infectious diseases. His approach is to study different mechanisms employed by micro-organisms to circumvent the effects of antimicrobial agents and explore new strategies for fighting various bacterial and fungal diseases. As the name of his Chair suggests, Dr. Berghuis will pursue his research using structural biology. Using x-ray crystallographic techniques, he will examine the three-dimensional structure of proteins responsible for conferring drug resistance. With this approach he hopes to gain insight into the phenomenon of drug resistance and, by determining the atomic structure of proteins that are critical to pathogenic bacteria and fungi, obtain knowledge that will lead to the development of drugs that can be used to combat these micro-organisms.While the development of novel antimicrobial agents is the main objective of the research program, an extremely important component of the program is the development of methods in computer-aided drug design that use data obtained through structural biology techniques.

For example, determination of poverty and inequality within society are vital to formulating economic policies that can affect the lives of millions. Unfortunately, estimates of these types of measures are quite unreliable when based on common statistical methods. Frequently, policies are put in place based on little more than good faith because reliable methods of evaluating the results of existing policies are not available.The focus of Dr. Russell Davidson's work over the past two decades has been on developing new approaches to making inferences based on statistical data. Among his achievements have been substantial improvements to results derived from application of the so-called bootstrap method of estimating the probability distribution of a statistic. Working in conjunction with James MacKinnon, Dr. Davidson developed a way of greatly simplifying and shortening the computations needed to implement the bootstrap method. This allows the bootstrap to be applied in situations where the difficulty of the required computations might otherwise make it infeasible.His program at McGill University will build on his achievements, extending the use of the bootstrap method to a wide variety of econometric applications, including inequality and poverty measurement. He will also focus on developing computational methods that make his new bootstrap techniques easy to use.Dr. Davidson expects that his new work will have its greatest impact on everyday econometric practice. His primary goal is to discover techniques and methods that improve econometrics by increasing efficiency and ease of application. He believes that only through additional work will the bootstrap method reach its potential as a tool to influence policy decisions. "

Emitting bursts of radiation as they rotate, these objects pulse regularly like exotic lighthouses.Neutron stars represent the final stages of the life of a star that has exploded. As a result, they can tell us a great deal about the properties of larger stars, how they collapse, and what happens to them as they do so.They also tell us a great deal about how matter behaves under conditions of radiation and gravity that are more extreme than anything we could duplicate in a laboratory. What we learn about this physical behaviour opens up new avenues for understanding the very nature of matter, and how we might deal with it under less extreme settings here on earth.For that reason, the questions surrounding the properties of neutron stars have major implications for a broad range of issues in astrophysics, as well as physics in general. Victoria Kaspi has examined many of those issues, using earth-based observatories as well as a new generation of orbiting satellites designed for astronomical research.Her work has focused specifically on the timing of electromagnetic pulses from neutron stars, which can indicate the degree of turbulence in the almost empty space between stars.

Not a standard dosage calculated by body weight-disregarding your age, sex, or pain threshold. But a regimen of pain-relieving therapy calculated just for you. Sound too good to be true? Not really. The era of designer painkillers may sound like science fiction, but it's fast approaching. In this new universe of individualized drug therapy, designer painkillers would be based on each patient's genetic markers. And on the specific environmental factors that triggered that patient's reaction to pain. The concept was born less than a decade ago, when Jeffrey Mogil and colleagues identified sex-specific genetic circuitry that governs the way males and females respond to pain. The groundbreaking discovery-since confirmed by other scientists-opened a whole new field. Now researchers are exploring the different ways that pain affects men and women. Scientists have long known that when asked to plunge an arm into ice-cold water, some people have no trouble leaving it there for three minutes. Others can't stand the discomfort for even one minute. A standard dosage of morphine relieves the pain of most patients. But for 20 percent of the population, even a high dose is ineffective. Up until now, this type of reaction was mostly a mystery. Mogil's research is beginning to provide the reasons for those different responses, which often vary by gender. Following his initial breakthrough, Mogil has been examining the genetic bases and environmental influences that combine to govern reactions to pain. At a minimum, pinpointing relevant genes can help doctors tailor dosages of drugs to each patient's needs. At best, Mogil's work may lead to new drugs providing life-saving pain relief, as anyone living with chronically debilitating conditions such as arthritis or ruptured discs can attest. The research chair at McGill University will not only help to consolidate Montreal's reputation as a leading centre for pain research, it will secure Mogil's return to Canada from the United States. Ultimately, it will increase Canada's competitive advantage in this promising new field of research. "

It has long been known that hormones and growth factors play an important part in the development of malignancy in humans, and estrogen receptors have long been useful predictive prognostic indicators.Dr. William Muller's work to date has focused on elucidating the molecular mechanism by which oncogenes - genes that turn normal cells into tumorous cells - are involved in inducing breast cancer in a murine system. He has also developed a large series of transgenic animals that have allowed him to address the effects of various signalling and growth factors in the development of malignancy. As Canada Research Chair in Molecular Oncology, Dr. Muller plans to continue to investigate the interrelationship between distinct hormone, growth factor and signalling pathways in the induction of breast cancer. He will do this by using a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches, with transgenic mouse models. He believes that his molecular studies into the basis of breast cancer will lead to the discovery of new proteins that play a key role in the induction of the disease.Dr. Muller's research will overlap four areas that McGill University's Faculty of Medicine focuses on: integrative genomics, molecular medicine, bioinformatics and structural biology.

His work will also be a part of the integrated research that is going to be conducted at the McGill Life Sciences Complex. His interests also extend to a specialized class of proteins known as chaperones, which oversee how proteins fold themselves into the correct shape to carry out their physiological duties. These proteins play a significant role in medical problems such as Alzheimer's disease or immune system disorders, a role that might serve as the target for an innovative drug therapy.The work of Dr. Thomas and his colleagues builds on pioneering research into a molecular chaperone called calnexin, which acts as a quality control mechanism for mutant proteins found within cells. When this mechanism fails to function, the improper folding of molecules can result in degenerative diseases. "

Vision scientists have developed many sophisticated theories about how we are able to detect, discriminate, and identify simple patterns such as spots and lines. But we are still a long way from understanding whether these theories can account for our remarkable ability to perceive complex patterns such as the face of a friend. As the Canada Research Chair in Vision Science, Patrick Bennett will join a team of researchers at McMaster University whose combined multidisciplinary expertise is unique within Canada and around the world. This multidisciplinary approach will enable Dr. Bennett to further our understanding of the hidden complexities underlying vision in everyday tasks. His work will apply advanced quantitative methods to determine how sensory and cognitive processes constrain our perception of the world, and will take advantage of modern medical imaging techniques to determine the precise nature of the neural systems underlying this perception. An additional focus of this work involves understanding how neural systems that underlie perception in adult brains change as a function of learning and aging. It is becoming increasingly clear that neural circuits are not fixed in the adult brain, and that new neurons can be generated throughout our lifetimes. These results raise the exciting possibility that behavioural therapies might be used to counteract the effects of injury or aging by stimulating the development of new functional networks in the brain.Dr. Bennett's own research has already shown that young and old brains encode visual information in very different ways, and that the strategies used by the brain for visual recognition can change dramatically as a function of learning. The goals of future work are to understand the conditions that enable perceptual learning to occur, to identify the ways in which visual mechanisms change with experience, and to determine whether practice on perceptual and cognitive tasks can produce long-lasting improvements in visual performance in older adults. The results of this work may lead to the development of innovative behavioural therapies to diminish the effects of aging on vision, and to enhance the quality of life for older Canadians. "

In his program as Canada Research Chair in Electron Microscopy of Nanostructured Materials, Dr. Botton will use TEM/EELS technology to achieve three goals: improve techniques to detect signals from few atomic layers at interfaces and nanostructures; develop models to describe the analytical data in terms of structure and bonding changes; and describe the relationships between the observations and the properties of the materials.His research will fall into three separate projects.First, he will examine the interfaces in nanostructured materials to provide high-resolution spectroscopic data to understand the structure and bonding relationships at interfaces and relate the data to the properties of these interfaces in engineering applications. This project will make it possible to understand the important elements that control the properties so that interfaces can be designed effectively, or new effects can be discovered and exploited.Second, his examination of the structure and bonding in nanoparticles for energy storage and catalysis will focus on the relationships between the microstructures observed at the nanometre level (shape, size and chemical state of nanoparticles) and the ultimate properties that are measured by macroscopic techniques. Nanoparticles that form airborne pollution will also be studied.Finally, he will focus on metallic and semiconductor thin films in devices to develop quantitative techniques to analyze the chemical composition at the nanometre level.

Much of his work is in the entrapment of biomolecules into sol-gel derived glasses, which leads to development of improved bioanalytical devices. His work intertwines materials science, biochemistry and analytical chemistry in a unique manner to produce new assays and analytical devices that have the potential to revolutionize the areas of biosensing and drug discovery. The goal of his research group is to become a world leader in the development of advanced sol-gel based biomaterials, biosensor technologies and high-throughput drug screening platforms.As Canada Research Chair in Bioanalytical Chemistry, Dr. Brennan will use a highly interdisciplinary approach to enable him to achieve his research goals of: developing new matrixes for the immobilization of functional biomolecules; the development of improved analytical devices based on sol-gel immobilized biomolecules, and; the extension of the range of biomolecules that can be used for sensing and screening purposes.

Deborah Cook's study of how to improve the medical profession's application of new knowledge could save lives. And it's all based on keeping a patient's chin up. Literally.The McMaster University professor is concentrating her research on a critical and often neglected area of study: how to translate new discoveries into effective clinical practice. Cook is focusing on studies that have discovered there is a practical, non-invasive way to reduce the risk of pneumonia in critically ill patients who are hooked up to ventilators in the Intensive Care Unit of hospitals.Statistics indicate that between 10% and 50% of all patients on mechanical ventilators develop pneumonia. The infection prolongs their time in hospital and increases their risk of dying. But studies have shown that if patients are elevated, by raising the head of the bed to a 45-degree angle, their risk of contracting this type of pneumonia drops drastically. All due to a simple re-positioning-from lying flat to sitting up. In fact, for every four patients repositioned this way, one case of pneumonia is prevented.Given the simplicity of the procedure, it should be applied in every ICU unit in Canada. But that's not always the case. Cook's study has demonstrated that caregivers in ICUs have not adopted the procedure. In addition, her research will use ventilator-associated pneumonia as a model to study ways to spread information quickly and to transfer research into best medical practice. It will also highlight an important lesson to the medical and research communities: that research that has practical applications must be applied so that the discoveries can have any meaning and effect on quality of life. The long-range, big picture? Cook's results can be applied to a variety of illnesses and to new ways to treat or prevent them.Cook was the first intensive-care specialist in Canada who is also educated in biostatistics and clinical epidemiology (the causes, distribution, and control of diseases in populations). The benefits have been numerous. Her combined specialties make her an ideal choice for this project with its cross-disciplinary connections. "

What we do have is calculus and its sophisticated mathematical approach to modelling the actions of the world around us.Non-linear partial differential equations (PDEs) are the mathematical language used to model the systems in the world around us that change over time. Modern examples include the transmission of data over fibre-optic cables, determining fluctuations in financial markets, the activities of drugs in biological systems, and the spread of infectious diseases. Formulating and studying the appropriate PDE always provides insight into the behaviour of the system, and hence has applications in its design and function.Walter Craig is coming to McMaster University after teaching at the California Institute of Technology, Stanford University, and Brown University. He specializes in PDEs and their applications to a broad range of questions in fields as diverse as hydrodynamics and astrophysics. During the course of this work, he has also cultivated strong interdisciplinary links, particularly in theoretical physics and physical chemistry. His research has regularly crossed mathematical frontiers, especially with respect to physical phenomena featuring waves. As the holder of a Canada Research Chair, he will continue to concentrate on some of most fundamental topics characterized by waves. This work promises to address some major outstanding problems for which tidy mathematical solutions are not possible. Craig, however, will attempt to frame more sophisticated and elegant solutions.

By any standard, it amounts to a major honour and accomplishment. But what makes it even more notable? The Nobel jury didn't even see some of Russell's most prodigious writing. However, thanks to Nicholas Griffin, the world will soon have access to a vast inventory of some of Russell's most intimate, fascinating, and revealing writing-thousands of personal letters that he wrote throughout his life (1872 to 1970). And they'll be available in a very modern way-via the World Wide Web.After Russell himself, Griffin is perhaps the person most familiar with this 20th century intellectual giant's copious writings. As the holder of the Canada Research Chair at McMaster University, Griffin has written five books on Russell, and has two more in the works. He is also the Director of the newly created Bertrand Russell Research Centre at McMaster.But while Russell is best known for such daunting works of mathematical logic as Principia Mathematica, Griffin says he was also one of the 20th century's great letter writers. McMaster University's Russell Archives-one of the world's major collections of the philosopher's work-has almost 50,000 of Russell's letters. How does Griffin account for the amazing volume? Russell devoted some part of each day to letter writing and, even in his nineties, was dictating 20 or more letters at a sitting. The letters range from the Victorian era to those of the Cold War. They were written to people in all walks of life-including dozens of world leaders-and on every topic under the sun. In his new role as Canada Research Chair holder, Griffin will work to see that this historical resource of original material is made globally accessible, and that it will remain as a valuable tool for future historians looking for insight into Russell's work and times. The planned on-line edition of Russell's collected letters will be organized to be of maximum use to scholars. The edition will include keyboarded text to make it searchable, as well as scanned images of the letters so that readers can view them as Russell wrote them. In addition to heading the on-line letters project, Griffin will also direct the editing of the ongoing edition of The Collected Papers of Bertrand Russell, currently at volume 16. "

In Canada, the annual cost associated with asthma and allied allergic respiratory diseases is estimated at more than one billion dollars. Costs are expected to increase given that the prevalence of asthma in Western countries has risen sharply during the last twenty years. While currently used inhaled steroids and short- and long-acting bronchodilators are highly effective to relieve symptoms, it is clear that they do not impact on the underlying mechanisms causing asthma. Dr. Manel Jordana's goal as Chair in Immune Biology of Respiratory Diseases and Allergy is to unravel the cellular and molecular basis of the host immune response to aeroallergens.Dr. Jordana's program builds upon his research into the processes of allergic sensitization and airway inflammation. His central challenge is to understand why some individuals develop harmful airway inflammatory responses to aeroallergens. Dr. Jordana's primary approach will seek to establish and further develop experimental models that mimic the heterogeneity of asthmatic inflammation so that the role of certain genes, and of interventions to neutralize the function of these genes, can be investigated. His hope is that dissecting the nature of the immunological interactions between the external environment, particularly aeroallergens, and the respiratory mucosa will have far-reaching implications for understanding and managing allergic airway diseases.

The current approach to this problem relies on accurate diagnosis and treatment with specific anticoagulant drugs. It would be more effective, however, to deal with thrombosis in a fundamental way, by understanding the underlying genetic and biochemical events that give rise to the problem in the first place.As holder of the Canada Research Chair in Thrombosis, Jeffrey Weitz will seek out this understanding. Following a comprehensive bench-to-bedside program, he will explore the most basic molecular dynamics responsible for this condition, expanding this research to develop clinical treatments that have value for patients who have already been diagnosed and are currently being treated.This approach has already improved the standard of care being given to thrombosis patients. Dr. Weitz and his colleagues demonstrated the efficacy of a new drug regimen that could be administered on an out-patient basis, improving the quality of life for these individuals by enabling them to recover at home. At the same time, the health care system saved the cost of the five- to seven-day hospital stay the former therapy entailed.Dr. Weitz has also characterized the structure and function of various clotting enzymes, and has used these insights to create new types of anticoagulant drugs that are now being tested. He intends to build on this success by examining the specific molecular changes that take place in blood vessel walls and give rise to thrombosis.

Timothy Whelan has designed a systematic study to address this century-old contradiction.The goal of this research is to identify the optimal use of radiation therapy in the treatment of women with breast cancer and other malignancies. This will involve developing reliable approaches where benefits are maximized and side effects are minimized. This study foresees better-managed radiation therapy leading to better quality of life for patients. Dr. Timothy Whelan's experience with clinical trials guided him in the design of the program. He and his colleagues, in collaboration with other research facilities, will search for ways to ""fine-tune"" cancer radiation therapy. They will attempt to answer such questions as: ""How frequently should radiation be used?"" or ""How much radiation is too much or, too little?"" Arriving at an optimal formula for treatment is the central goal of the research.Complementing the research into improved radiation therapy will be an assessment of health services. Supportive care for cancer patients has traditionally received less attention than drug and radiation therapy. This study will look at non-medical services, such as homecare, nutritional support, and social and psychological counselling.The study recognizes the need for patients to be better informed about their disease and their desire to have an active role in the decision-making process. Many patients regain a sense of control over the disease and their lives by taking an active part in the selection of treatment. Dr. Whelan considers it important to document the influence that patient control has in changing the prognosis of the disease. "

The list of infections associated with serious diseases like these is growing.In this environment, effective drugs are critical to do battle. But as the use of antibiotics becomes more widespread, so too does the growth of antibiotic resistance. It's the bugs against the drugs. And the bugs look like they're winning.Gerard Wright's research concentrates on understanding the mechanisms that promote antibiotic resistance and the reasons micro-organisms become resistant. He is particularly interested in the enzymes that alter or destroy antibiotics. By identifying resistance genes, expressing and purifying enzymes, and understanding their role in the process of antibiotic resistance, Wright hopes to gather data to help reverse this resistance and develop new drugs.To study existing antibiotics and why organisms balk at them, researchers need to synthesize them in a lab. But many of these antibiotics can't be chemically synthesized cost-effectively in large-enough quantities to allow chemists to modify them. Wright is working on understanding new ways to synthesize particularly critical groups of antibiotics, some of them the last effective treatments for emerging superbugs.The ultimate goal of this research is the development of new antibiotics. To do that, researchers have to understand the way they currently combat infection, and the body's molecular processes. Wright and his colleagues are using chemistry and biochemistry to examine the use of new agents in the war against infection. One such possibility is the use of amino acids as an antidote to fungal pathogens-another living micro-organism that causes both diseases in people, and major crop losses from infection.The chair Wright will hold at McMaster will contribute to the creation of the critical mass necessary to result in long-awaited breakthroughs in the fight to combat antibiotic resistance.

As holder of the Canada Research Chair at Mount Allison University's Coastal Wetlands Institute, Douglas Campbell will investigate the mechanisms that allow photosynthesis to succeed under such dynamically changing conditions. In studying the levels and functions of the proteins and other biochemical agents that contribute to photosynthesis, he seeks to identify those features that respond to outside conditions by controlling and regulating photosynthetic activity. Dr. Campbell has already made significant progress in identifying the sensing and signalling systems employed by organisms to maintain photosynthetic equilibrium. It is now more important than ever to learn how these systems function, given the numerous human influences that may disrupt that equilibrium. As examples of such human impacts, Dr. Campbell points to the rapid rise in levels of ultraviolet radiation (UV-B) and carbon dioxide that industrial pollution has caused, along with increased temperatures and cycling of soil nutrients. Key plants and bacteria may not be able to adapt to these changes, and their loss could bring further unpredictable changes to the environment.

These reactions control biological events and are part of the processes that regulate metabolism, gene expression and cell division, as well as growth, development, locomotion, learning and memory.Proteins in living cells ""talk"" to each other in order to achieve many cellular functions. One of the most common forms of communication in all organisms consists of adding or removing phosphate groups to proteins. Protein phosphorylation – the addition of a phosphate to a protein – is a critically important regulatory mechanism. Much like attaching a switch to a light bulb, addition of a phosphate group to a protein can turn the protein on or off and triggers its biological activity. While protein phosphorylation has been extensively studied in mammals, research lags in lower organisms such as bacteria. Dr. Zongchao Jia, Canada Research Chair in Structural Biology, has been examining the bacteria E. coli tyrosine kinase (Etk) which is involved in cell surface protection. Jia is using crystallography, a powerful technique that can provide direct visualization of the three-dimensional structure of a protein. Based on the ""picture"" he obtains, Jia is able to uncover important functional insights into Etk. Jia is also studying a unique bi-functional bacterial enzyme that enables bacterial growth in a low-nutrient environment. Jia’s research will improve knowledge of key enzymes that are uniquely found in bacteria and which may have potential for the development of selective antibiotics in the future. "

Dr. David Lillicrap believes that the common inherited bleeding disorders, which include the hemophilias and a less severe but more prevalent condition known as von Willebrand disease, represent excellent, distinct models from which to advance our knowledge of the pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment of genetic diseases. As a clinician/scientist of international stature, Dr. Lillicrap has spent the last fifteen years heading a leading team of researchers. Their far-reaching contributions range from analyzing the basic molecular genetic structure of clotting factor genes to investigating therapeutic interventions in patients with clinical bleeding disorders. As Chair in Molecular Hemostasis, Dr. Lillicrap is now focusing his research on three key projects, all relating to the genetics of common inherited blood disorders. His first project seeks to develop a large database of hemophilic mutations to further knowledge of the genetic mechanisms resulting in the hemophilias. Project two draws on the large amount of basic scientific knowledge that currently exists about hemophilia A to evaluate the safety and efficacy of different protocols for hemophilia gene therapy, and to investigate the host immune response to gene delivery. Lastly, Dr. Lillicrap is determining the effect of a number of genetic and micro-environmental influences on the severity of von Willebrand disease. Dr. Lillicrap's research is expected to aid in the development of innovative strategies to diagnose and treat these disorders using genetic approaches. In turn, this will greatly enhance the quality of life for patients, and will make the treatment of these disorders more widely available and affordable. "

However, it is now clear that this has not happened. On the contrary, the global era has coincided with the emergence or re-emergence of a significant number of nationalisms, including Quebec in Canada; Scotland and Wales in the United Kingdom; the Basque Country, Catalonia and Galicia in Spain; and Corsica in France. Dr. John F. McGarry, Canada Research Chair in Nationalism and Democracy, has established a global reputation as a scholar in the field of nationalism. His research program has two broad but related goals. First, he will study the phenomenon of minority nationalism and its relationship to globalization in a number of contexts, particularly in the European context where this process has developed the furthest. Second, Dr. McGarry will research methods in which these minority nationalisms can be managed in ways that are compatible with fairness and democratic governance. This involves two broad areas of inquiry: the role that exogenous actors, particularly the new international institutions associated with globalization, can play in reducing conflict; and the role that endogenous democratic institutional design can play in reducing conflict. A central aim of the Chair is to establish Queen's as a national centre for the graduate and post-doctoral study of minority nationalism and its management in the changing international environment. Different facets of Dr. McGarry's research will complement work being conducted in three interdisciplinary research centres at Queen's: the Centre for the Study of Democracy, the Centre for International Relations and the Institute of Intergovernmental Relations.

Dr. Ian Moore, Canada Research Chair in Infrastructure Engineering, is working to improve this situation. Moore’s research on the behaviour and design of buried pipelines is ensuring that Canada’s annual; multi-billion dollar investments in pipe systems are more effective and based on a better understanding of new pipe infrastructure performance, the remaining strength of deteriorated pipelines, and new methods of repair and replacement. Among Moore’s key contributions are studies examining how buried pipes interact with surrounding soil, and the consequences of soil erosion as water flows into leaking sewers and culverts. Moore and his research team are examining the risks associated with frost loads, earthquakes, landslides and other natural phenomena on these pipe systems, so engineers can design more resilient systems. Moore and his team are also investigating non-metal alternatives to oil and gas transmission pipes, eliminating the potential for corrosion and reducing the risk to the environment. Many of Moore’s design methods have been incorporated into North American and international pipe standards, and his procedures are used by consultants to manage the risk of infrastructure damage during construction. His work in explaining the “diseases” that affect aging pipelines also allows the engineers who manage them to address the causes rather than simply treating symptoms. "

But how much of a role does human activity play in environmental change? Are people responsible for global warming, or is it just part of a natural process? The science of paleolimnology may be the best way to answer these questions. Paleolimnology uses the physical, chemical and biological information stored in lake sediments to track environmental and ecological change. Sediment cores provide a record of change over years, centuries and beyond, offering unique insights into the history of climatic and ecological change. Dr. John Smol, Canada Research Chair in Environmental Change, leads an international program in the field of paleolimnology with four basic goals: to track long-term trends in climatic change and environmental pollution; to enhance research in the Arctic to track climatic and other environmental change; to develop new approaches to studying water-quality problems; and to develop new approaches to assessing pressing problems such as declining fish stocks. The work done by Smol and his research team is allowing scientists to offer advice on improving lake management strategies. Comparative national studies could tell us whether those guidelines can be applied to lakes across the country, or if they must be customized to each region or lake. This work is also enabling researchers to better understand and determine the role that human industrial activities play in climate change, and its effects on our ecosystems. "

His research program seeks to answer the key question of whether technology helps or hinders societal progress.The first of three streams of research he is pursuing is a philosophical one that is concerned with understanding technology as a social phenomenon. Growing out of a book examining the theories of Heidegger and Marcuse that Dr. Feenberg is writing, he will look at the origins of mass media and industrial design and their relation to the artistic avant gardes of the early 20th century.The second stream of study involves the development of case studies that illustrate the way technology impacts society and influences societal change. In particular, Dr. Feenberg will study the interactions between public will, economic forces and technical innovation.The third stream of his work will examine the state of on-line education and attempt to devise ways the software could be improved to deliver a better experience to users. As a co-founder of the School of Management and Strategic Studies at the Western Behavioural Sciences Institute in La Jolla, California, Dr. Feenberg helped to develop some of the earliest methods in on-line education. Since then, he has become an outspoken critic of the evolution of the technology, and has undertaken research to evaluate the software currently used and its affect on on-line education participants.

Many other bacterial diseases respond only to a single antibiotic, and are evolving at such a rate that they’ll soon be able to resist all available antibiotics. The way bacteria usually grow in humans (as communities called biofilms) enables them to adapt and become resistant to most antibiotics over time. As Canada Research Chair in Health and Genomics, Dr. Robert Hancock is developing new antimicrobial strategies based on an improved understanding of how antibiotics work and how microorganisms are increasingly able to resist even the most effective drugs. Hancock is examining the way small proteins called host-defence peptides—which are involved in the natural mechanisms of host defence against microbes—kill antibiotic-resistant bacteria. His research focuses on how they overcome biofilm-mediated resistance and stimulate innate protective immunity. Hancock’s research is already providing evidence that so-called innate defence regulator peptides could potentially be used as a new class of drugs to fight infections by enhancing immunity. Other peptides have the ability to destroy the antibiotic-resistant biofilms that cause two-thirds of hospital infections. Hancock and his research team are also developing and using advanced computer programs to study how the body responds to infection and inflammatory diseases.

Hayden's research examines how changes in genes result in illnesses such as Huntington's disease (HD), cholesterol metabolism and diabetes, and adverse drug reactions (pharmacogenomics). His findings are leading to new approaches to preventing and treating these and other neurodegenerative diseases. Hayden and his research team have developed antisense oligonucleotide drugs—gene “silencing” drugs that turn off production of the mutant huntingtin protein (the protein responsible for HD)—by targeting specific DNA variations. These drugs are being evaluated in a mouse that has human huntingtin genes with the targeted DNA variations. Hayden’s findings could lead to the development of a drug to be tested on people suffering from HD. Hayden's research into human lipoprotein lipase deficiency has already led to the development of gene therapy for hyperlipidemia and the approval of the first gene therapy product in the western world.

These surfaces make it possible to construct biosensors or diagnostic detectors for isolating sensitive biological products, which can then be processed without contamination or fouling.Charles Haynes has been among those who have developed such systems. He introduced a chromatographic approach to separating biomolecules on the basis of size, which has now become standard in the bioprocessing industry. More recently his work has focused on developing novel micro-arrays that employ peptide nucleic acids to interact with DNA, obtaining information about genes much more quickly and efficiently. As holder of the Canada Research Chair in Interfacial Biotechnology, Dr. Haynes will explore the molecular basis of such interactions. He will then apply this fundamental knowledge to the design of natural or synthetic surfaces that will make it possible to analyze complex biosystems at the molecular level, innovations that will prove to be crucial to the development of the entire field of biotechnology.

To achieve these results, the team is collaborating with visiting scientists from the U.S., France, Israel, Holland and Canada, postdoctoral fellows and graduate students.Pondering fundamental scientific questions is important to all modern societies. By gaining a deeper mathematical understanding of certain simplified models of interacting species, Dr. Perkins' research may eventually improve our knowledge of more complex models, and provide valuable predictability tools for application in other mathematical fields.

You probably see icons and the glow of a computer screen. But Tim Salcudean sees it differently. He sees a virtual world full of movement and touch.Salcudean is a world-leading expert in haptic interfaces. These interfaces allow computer users to feel and apply the forces of interaction while manipulating remote or virtual environments. The newly appointed Canada Research Chair in Intelligent Computer Interface Design at the University of British Columbia is researching the application of haptic computer interface systems to surgery and medical diagnosis and the remote operation of machinery in forestry and mining. In 1990, he made international headlines when, for the first time ever, he enabled scientists to feel atom-scale surface features. In 1997, he also received media attention for a vibration isolation device that he co-developed with Canadian astronaut Bjarni Truggvason. The device enabled scientific experiments to be carried out on the Space Shuttle and may also be used on the International Space Station.Salcudean's latest research is a continuation of this extensive track record of putting technical innovations to work. In collaboration with UBC colleagues, he will continue R&D; to create a multi-modal user interface-using sight, touch and sound-for robot-assisted medical ultrasound that could one day be used in hospitals and clinics all across Canada. Many ultrasound technicians currently suffer repetitive strain injuries in the course of their work. The robotic system will not only alleviate this, but will also allow for more precise and repeatable examinations and for ultrasound image-guided interventions.In addition, Salcudean has shown himself to be a prodigious graduate student supervisor. Over the past ten years at UBC, he has supervised 30 Masters and Ph.D. students, as well as several post-doctoral researchers. The Canada Research Chair position will not only allow Salcudean to continue his exciting work to the benefit of the Canadian medical community and the technology sector, it will also act as a further magnet to attract students from around the world to UBC.

Aboriginal people who use drugs face a disproportionate number of health threats, including HIV, hepatitis C, and death from overdose. Similarly, HIV has had a devastating impact on people in sub-Saharan Africa. Dr. Martin Schechter, Canada Research Chair in HIV/AIDS and Urban Population Health, has designed a research program that concentrates on young Aboriginal people in Canada who use drugs, and on people in northern Uganda whose lives have been shattered by a 20-year war. His research will monitor the incidence and risk factors for HIV and other harms, with the aim of developing effective prevention programs. His studies will focus on the effects of trauma as well as on identifying the factors that promote resilience. Schechter and his research team will also pursue clinical research on innovative treatments for heroin addiction, including medically prescribed heroin. They will develop new methods for providing effective health care to people with severe addiction, and for protecting them from the harms they face. A Canadian leader in the field of HIV and addiction research, Schechter hopes the results of his research will benefit Canadians with the greatest need as well as those devastated by war in sub-Saharan Africa, helping to ensure that we truly promote health for all.

Schluter believes the sticklebacks will provide genetic and ecological evidence of how natural selection drives the process.New environments created by geological upheaval can accelerate the formation of new species. Schluter is studying the evolution of the stickleback as a result of one of these periods of upheaval. Since the final retreat of the glaciers in British Columbia, thousands of variants of the original stickleback species, still found in coastal marine waters, have formed in freshwater. The freshwater fish include brand-new species, as well as populations at the intermediate stages of evolution.By comparing the different variations of sticklebacks, Schluter can assess how the populations evolve and diverge in traits and behaviour as they are faced with different resources, competitors, and predators. He is also able to cross-breed the new species in the lab, although they refuse to mate in the wild. The offspring of these fish will allow the scientists to examine and to shuffle genes. This will ultimately allow them to trace the genes that are responsible for the evolution of new traits and the origin of species.Mapping the genes of the stickleback and studying their evolutionary progress will help scientists figure out, and hopefully forestall, the reasons species are vulnerable to extinction. Schluter's research is documenting a model system of species for study, which can provide compelling examples of how natural selection works-fulfilling Darwin's design. "

Along the way, it affects sleep, mood, and cognition. In Canada, some 100,000 people suffer from Parkinson’s. The estimated annual cost to the health care system is $2 billion. To better understand what causes Parkinson’s and how best to treat it, Dr. A. Jon Stoessl, Canada Research Chair in Parkinson’s Disease, is examining the evolution of dopamine changes in the brains of Parkinson’s sufferers. Dopamine is a key chemical messenger in the brain that is released by nerve cells. The brain responds to most types of reward by increasing levels of dopamine. Dopamine, in turn, sends signals to other nerve cells. Damage to the neurons that produce dopamine is responsible for most of the physical symptoms of Parkinson's. Yet scientists increasingly recognize that the disease also affects other brain regions—possibly many years before a person even begins to lose dopamine nerve cells. Using positron emission tomography (PET) imaging, Stoessl and his research team are studying people who don’t yet have Parkinson’s, but who are considered at high risk of developing it. They are examining why exercise appears to benefit Parkinson's patients, improving their mood as well as physical function. They hope to identify patterns of abnormal dopamine function, and understand how non-dopamine systems may also be affected. This research could provide a first-ever record of the progression of Parkinson's in otherwise healthy brains. "

One of the longest standing problems in gravitational theory and cosmology has been to achieve a theoretical understanding of physics in extreme gravitational environments, such as black holes. In recent years, much of the interest in the field of particle physics has centred on string theory, which studies speculative models that seek to explain the nature and interactions of all of the elementary constituents of matter. String theory is now considered to be the frontier of gravitational research.String theory continues to evolve rapidly, and the past five years have seen some major discoveries, which in turn have raised new questions about how particles act and why.As Canada Research Chair in String Theory, Dr. Mark Van Raamsdonk plans to pursue three of the areas in which questions have been raised by recent developments: D-branes, Matrix Theory, and non-commutative field theories.Dr. Van Raamsdonk believes that it is essential to improve the general comprehension of string theory for it to be used to understand how it affected the cosmology of the early universe and how it may describe the world we observe today. The overall goal of his research is to work towards an understanding of the laws of nature at their most fundamental level. He firmly believes that string theory is the best candidate of all existing scientific findings to provide a consistent description of quantum gravity and a unified understanding of all fundamental particles and forces in nature.

His work has crossed many disciplinary lines, including biology, computer science and engineering, and has drawn extensive interest from a variety of organizations around the world.His program at the University of British Columbia as Canada Research Chair in Speech and Cognitive Science will build on his work during the previous decade at Japan's ATR Labs, particularly the development of a realistic ""talking head"" model that captures many of the fine motor and muscle movements associated with human speech production. The model incorporates three-dimensional features of the vocal tract, face and head to generate acoustic and visual signals in which the movements of larynx, tongue, jaw and lips are linked structurally and functionally to the motions of the head and face.Dr. Vatikiotis-Bateson's program will provide research benefits that overlap with several fields of endeavour.For example, using the talking head speech synthesizer, his team will enable research into the development and pathology of speech in children. The talking head synthesis system will provide a useful tool for studying anatomical abnormalities and limitations on neurological control. Another application will be the extraction of facial movements related to languages that are viewed as endangered. The results could be used to develop computer-based educational tools for teaching these languages in the future.

Which is truly extraordinary considering that the boys and girls she studies are too young to walk or talk. As the new Canada Research Chair in Psychology at the University of British Columbia, Werker will build on two decades of cutting-edge research during which she has precisely documented the first mental steps in normal language learning. Her goal is to use this knowledge for the early detection of children at risk for language difficulties. And considering her experience-in documenting the earliest stages of language learning, this world-leading psychologist has achieved several research firsts-the project is in good hands. In the early 1980s, Werker demonstrated that infants in their first months of life can already distinguish between similar-sounding consonants and vowels. She also demonstrated that this ability is universal: babies can distinguish these differences in any language. In the 1990s, Werker extended this research to toddlers and the initial stages of word learning. Her research overturned earlier theories of word learning by demonstrating that one-year-olds avoid the fine phonetic detail of new words in order to better focus on the overall sound of the words. In collaboration with an international team of colleagues, Werker is also turning her attention to language development in bilingual and multilingual children. Her preliminary research in this field has produced intriguing results, for it suggests that listening experience early in life, even in utero, influences the way infants perceive language. What else does Werker plan to do with her research findings? She's using this basic knowledge of early language learning to develop methods for early identification of language disorders. She's also testing word learning and speech perception in premature infants and those genetically at risk for delayed language development. "

Dr. Annalee Yassi, Canada Research Chair in Global Health and Capacity Building, is exploring issues that affect health workers’ ability to do their jobs. These issues can range from how best to prevent disabilities caused by work stress to preventing infectious disease transmission—with a focus on hepatitis and influenza in the Canadian context, and HIV and tuberculosis in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The knowledge and experience arising from her work is also being applied in ongoing international efforts to prevent and respond to outbreaks of this nature.

The costs associated with treating allergies - for drugs, time spent by healthcare workers and lost productivity as people miss work - is tremendous. So is the misery of the people inflicted with the illnesses.Kent HayGlass and his colleagues at the University of Manitoba's Immune Regulation of Allergy Research Group are dedicated to discovering why some people develop allergies and others do not, even though we are all exposed to similar amounts of common allergens (grass pollen, ragweed, cats and dust mites). They also want to develop consistently effective ways of redirecting the way the body's immune system responds protectively to allergies. HayGlass is a leading researcher in the field of immune regulation. He studies the roles played by cytokines, immunological hormones that control the development, activation and inhibition of immunity. HayGlass' work with cytokines also relates to research that he and Frank Plummer, recipient of a new Canada Research Chair, are conducting which explores the reasons why some sex workers in Kenya are resistant to HIV. Deciphering that secret would open up an exciting new avenue into vaccines or drug treatments to fight AIDS. HayGlass is also investigating the mechanisms that underlie successful transplantation and the development of vaccines. Uniting all these studies is the goal of understanding the basic biology of immune regulation so that scientists can develop new drugs or strategies to prevent or treat these diseases.Awarding HayGlass this research chair will enable him to pursue further studies into the way cells and molecular controls direct the immune system to protect the body - or fail to fight off invading disease. The chair will further strengthen the capacity of the Allergy Research Group at the university and give Canada another world class centre in this important area of public health. "

This is the revolutionary idea Dr. Lorrie Kirshenbaum, Canada Research Chair in Molecular Cardiology, is exploring in his research into regulating the growth and death of cardiac muscle cells.Kirshenbaum is fascinated by the behaviour of cells of the heart, which lose their ability to divide shortly after we are born and either increase in size or die. This is a critical problem for patients who have heart disease, because heart cells that die cannot be replaced. Kirshenbaum is studying ways to manipulate cell survival at the genetic level. His research has already demonstrated that particular genes are intimately involved in both the life and death of these cardiac cells. Aided by cutting edge gene therapy, Kirshenbaum is using viruses to deliver genes into cardiac muscle cells to direct them how to live longer and resist injury following heart attack.By introducing new DNA (genes) into these cells, scientists could potentially direct cells to suppress or kill cancer cells, or to kill off other genes which are provoking the death of cells that heart patients need.Kirshenbaum's research could have ground-breaking implications for heart disease, which is responsible for almost half of all deaths in Canada. Limiting the number of dying heart cells following a heart attack would greatly reduce the effects of heart disease. "

The human hand is an excellent example. A remarkable piece of engineering, the human hand can reach out and grasp objects with exquisite precision—far more precision than any robotic hand. One of the factors that makes this possible is our keen sense of sight. Dr. Mel Goodale, Canada Research Chair in Visual Neuroscience, is studying the different kinds of information used by the human visual system to guide the hand as it reaches out and grasps an object—as well as how previous experience with an object interacts with current visual information. For this research, Goodale and his research team use sensitive infra-red cameras to track tiny infra-red lights that have been attached to the fingertips, hand, and wrist. They use the data from these cameras to reconstruct the trajectory of the hand and fingers as the grasping movement unfolds. Goodale also uses brain imaging (functional magnetic resonance imaging, or fMRI) to explore how the brain calculates the sizes and locations of the objects being grasped. This work is not only providing basic information about how vision is used to control the human hand, but is also contributing to the design of better systems for controlling robot hands. "
